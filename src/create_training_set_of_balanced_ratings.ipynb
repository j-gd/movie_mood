       "      <td>Dickens writing is poetry of the highest order, and as a story teller he has few peers.  Henry Winkler's monotone delivery of the Christmas Carol combined with a trite and confusing screen play was only made worse by the frequent interruptions of a black screen, since this was an adaptation of a TV production in 1979 converted to a DVD.  The make-up in the movie was distracting to a fault, looking like it had been applied with a masonry trowel and topped by one of the worst hairpieces since George Burns was alive.Although the new Scrooge's premise had promise by changing the setting of the story from Victorian England to Depression Era America, the writers did not take advantage of the fairy tale capacities of the story and moral lessons, best taught as allegories.  In this sense having the four visitations (Marley, plus Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) done in the context of real-life characters from the TV production itself, had a less dramatic impact on the events.  Simply stated, Marley should have been a tortured spirit, attempting to right a long life of wrong decisions instead of appearing like a characterized mobster from a B-movie.  In addition the 70's hipster, as Christmas Yet to Come, was several decades from being relevant to the plot, or as sinister, foreboding and silent as the representation of a lonely death.  Last, but not least, the conclusion of the story appeared rushed and lacked substance, more so than many versions I have seen. In this sense sending the young boy to Australia to cure his malady was more detail than I required and most likely confusing to anyone not familiar with the period in America.This review (2012) is based on a recent watching of the video I purchased a number of years ago for my collection. However, if you are reading this you should understand the context in which the TV movie was made.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity from the Happy Days series when he portrayed this part, and in addition to his early success, has evolved into an accomplished actor, director, producer and author.  It all goes to show you that one bad decision does not a career make, so there is hope for all of us, every one.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The film is probably historically accurate, for the most part, except in some very key points.  I have not done extensive study on history and ancient civilizations, but I can read the Bible.  At first I was quite pleased with their faithfulness to the Biblical account, but then I believe the filmmakers departed from the written account on some of the most crucial details of the story.At certain key points, Joseph was portrayed as incapable of standing on his own, apparently needing women to help him understand what was going on, to help him forgive his brothers, etc.  That's not the Joseph I read about.  Then Pharaoh needed women to convince him that Joseph knew what he was talking about.  That is not at all the case.  (And I am not against women.)  Pharaoh was the one who immediately recognized what was in Joseph.  Genesis 41:38  \"Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?\"  He recognized that on the first encounter.  There was no second conversation with Joseph about the dreams.  Pharaoh did not dismiss him on the first encounter.What was the point of rushing down to get Joseph when he was brought back to Pharaoh, stripping his clothes off, and having two young ladies wash him from behind?  I don't read that anyone tried to scare Joseph when they told him Pharaoh wanted to see him.  Genesis 41:14 says that \"they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.\"Another reviewer writes, \"Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young...\"  What about single or married, young or old guys, watching practically R rated scenes?  I don't think people other than children are immune from being provoked.  Does an interest in history and Bible stories have to subject us to sexually explicit material?And what is the point of showing Joseph's wife in the bath?  I bet they had to shoot that scene repeatedly to keep from showing her breasts in the angles from the front, and it required split second timing in editing to keep from showing her behind as she was getting out of the pool.  Is that required to tell the story of Joseph?Some of the rest of the material might make sense if it were called the story of Genesis.  But what does the story of Joseph have to do with Judah's escapade with Tamar?  Is that really an integral part of the story of Joseph?  I think the director was glad to have a little more material, having the opportunity to show a situation with someone preparing to make out with a harlot, showing all the way up to the point where she begins to lift her dress and bare her leg, leaving the rest to your imagination.I will not dispute that two of Joseph's brothers wiped out all the males in a city as revenge for their sister being raped (Genesis 34).  Of course many details are up to the film maker, but it struck me as being unnecessary to show those same men saying, \"Praise be to God\" (or some such similar phrase) in one breath, and then plotting to kill all the males in the next breath.  Again, I'm not sure how critical that whole incident is to the story of Joseph.  Maybe it is--I won't argue too much on that point.And the Jacob (Joseph's father) we see in the film is not the Jacob I imagine.  He looked pretty weak, lacking in self-confidence, and lacking in confidence in God.  I don't think Jacob was quite so timid.  That's my personal reading of the scriptures.The story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible, but I would like to forget most of what I saw.  For me, the scene where Joseph was reunited with his brothers was weak.  What about Joseph weeping aloud, and \"the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.\"  (Genesis 45:2)  Couldn't the actor muster up that kind of emotion?Seeing the film did help me to imagine a little better what it was like when certain things happened.  Joseph crying out from the pit was particularly poignant.  But I would not recommend this film to anyone.  To me, it's not an accurate representation of what happened, and it does not portray Joseph as the strong man of God that he was.If you are watching this film to get a better understanding of the Bible, I think you should be careful. I don't think this movie was written by a Christian or directed by a Christian.  I think it could possibly just be a ploy to dupe gullible Christians into watching a sexually explicit movie (with historically accurate stuff mixed in), and slightly distorting their understanding of what actually happened.  I think we should be careful about who we rely on to interpret the Bible for us.</td>\n",

Judging by the reviews I read by others, the film continues to inaccurately portray many other critically important facts about the life of Joseph.

       "167  I thought I remembered this film as a good one from television many years ago but I had obviously forgotten it completely. It's poor quality film, dated and badly written. Henry Winkler's make up is just awful. I couldn't watch it through to the end. I collect Christmas Carol films  but this one that will never go in the dvd player again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "175  Dickens writing is poetry of the highest order, and as a story teller he has few peers.  Henry Winkler's monotone delivery of the Christmas Carol combined with a trite and confusing screen play was only made worse by the frequent interruptions of a black screen, since this was an adaptation of a TV production in 1979 converted to a DVD.  The make-up in the movie was distracting to a fault, looking like it had been applied with a masonry trowel and topped by one of the worst hairpieces since George Burns was alive.Although the new Scrooge's premise had promise by changing the setting of the story from Victorian England to Depression Era America, the writers did not take advantage of the fairy tale capacities of the story and moral lessons, best taught as allegories.  In this sense having the four visitations (Marley, plus Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) done in the context of real-life characters from the TV production itself, had a less dramatic impact on the events.  Simply stated, Marley should have been a tortured spirit, attempting to right a long life of wrong decisions instead of appearing like a characterized mobster from a B-movie.  In addition the 70's hipster, as Christmas Yet to Come, was several decades from being relevant to the plot, or as sinister, foreboding and silent as the representation of a lonely death.  Last, but not least, the conclusion of the story appeared rushed and lacked substance, more so than many versions I have seen. In this sense sending the young boy to Australia to cure his malady was more detail than I required and most likely confusing to anyone not familiar with the period in America.This review (2012) is based on a recent watching of the video I purchased a number of years ago for my collection. However, if you are reading this you should understand the context in which the TV movie was made.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity from the Happy Days series when he portrayed this part, and in addition to his early success, has evolved into an accomplished actor, director, producer and author.  It all goes to show you that one bad decision does not a career make, so there is hope for all of us, every one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "387  I have purchased allot of VHS tapes from you but this one is defective. I bought it for an elderly lady in a nursing home and she and my mother have stated that is has blank spots and hangs up. I hope you can replace this tape for Louise Hornbeck. I did not purchase a used tape, I purchased a NEW tape. Pls replace,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "453  The film is probably historically accurate, for the most part, except in some very key points.  I have not done extensive study on history and ancient civilizations, but I can read the Bible.  At first I was quite pleased with their faithfulness to the Biblical account, but then I believe the filmmakers departed from the written account on some of the most crucial details of the story.At certain key points, Joseph was portrayed as incapable of standing on his own, apparently needing women to help him understand what was going on, to help him forgive his brothers, etc.  That's not the Joseph I read about.  Then Pharaoh needed women to convince him that Joseph knew what he was talking about.  That is not at all the case.  (And I am not against women.)  Pharaoh was the one who immediately recognized what was in Joseph.  Genesis 41:38  \"Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?\"  He recognized that on the first encounter.  There was no second conversation with Joseph about the dreams.  Pharaoh did not dismiss him on the first encounter.What was the point of rushing down to get Joseph when he was brought back to Pharaoh, stripping his clothes off, and having two young ladies wash him from behind?  I don't read that anyone tried to scare Joseph when they told him Pharaoh wanted to see him.  Genesis 41:14 says that \"they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.\"Another reviewer writes, \"Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young...\"  What about single or married, young or old guys, watching practically R rated scenes?  I don't think people other than children are immune from being provoked.  Does an interest in history and Bible stories have to subject us to sexually explicit material?And what is the point of showing Joseph's wife in the bath?  I bet they had to shoot that scene repeatedly to keep from showing her breasts in the angles from the front, and it required split second timing in editing to keep from showing her behind as she was getting out of the pool.  Is that required to tell the story of Joseph?Some of the rest of the material might make sense if it were called the story of Genesis.  But what does the story of Joseph have to do with Judah's escapade with Tamar?  Is that really an integral part of the story of Joseph?  I think the director was glad to have a little more material, having the opportunity to show a situation with someone preparing to make out with a harlot, showing all the way up to the point where she begins to lift her dress and bare her leg, leaving the rest to your imagination.I will not dispute that two of Joseph's brothers wiped out all the males in a city as revenge for their sister being raped (Genesis 34).  Of course many details are up to the film maker, but it struck me as being unnecessary to show those same men saying, \"Praise be to God\" (or some such similar phrase) in one breath, and then plotting to kill all the males in the next breath.  Again, I'm not sure how critical that whole incident is to the story of Joseph.  Maybe it is--I won't argue too much on that point.And the Jacob (Joseph's father) we see in the film is not the Jacob I imagine.  He looked pretty weak, lacking in self-confidence, and lacking in confidence in God.  I don't think Jacob was quite so timid.  That's my personal reading of the scriptures.The story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible, but I would like to forget most of what I saw.  For me, the scene where Joseph was reunited with his brothers was weak.  What about Joseph weeping aloud, and \"the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.\"  (Genesis 45:2)  Couldn't the actor muster up that kind of emotion?Seeing the film did help me to imagine a little better what it was like when certain things happened.  Joseph crying out from the pit was particularly poignant.  But I would not recommend this film to anyone.  To me, it's not an accurate representation of what happened, and it does not portray Joseph as the strong man of God that he was.If you are watching this film to get a better understanding of the Bible, I think you should be careful. I don't think this movie was written by a Christian or directed by a Christian.  I think it could possibly just be a ploy to dupe gullible Christians into watching a sexually explicit movie (with historically accurate stuff mixed in), and slightly distorting their understanding of what actually happened.  I think we should be careful about who we rely on to interpret the Bible for us.   \n",
       "524  Utterly grievous... My wife and I didn't make it past the stomach sickening, unbiblical, immoral scene where she's grabbing Joseph's jewels in the bath. We were both very disturbed. I thought I was watching a family film, not a porno-promo. Twenty minutes later and I still feel sickened. Judging by the reviews I read by others, the film continues to inaccurately portray many other critically important facts about the life of Joseph. It's not worth watching the truth of God's Holy Word twisted and profaned for the sake of enjoying ourselves with unholy entertainment.

       "      <td>I have to admit that I am a fan of Giada's cooking and I had great expectations when I ordered this set. They were however, crushed. While I still love Giada's cooking, this set is just a way for Food Network to make money. They really cheated with these DVD's. All they have are the video from the show, no text recipes, no link to the on line shows and no computer support. They play in Windows media player but the set does not contain the recipes. You can get more by taping the shows and then going to the web to download recipes. Another disappointment is the so so transfer quality to DVD. Perhaps I've been spoiled by HD and Tivo but the older shows I've recorded have had better playback quality than the episodes on the DVD's. It is in the old 480p but the quality of the transfer to DVD is dark and about the same quality as your average old VHS tape, not DVD quality. I get the impression Food Network got cheap and subbed out the DVD transfer to the lowest bidder (China?) and it shows.I could watch Giada read the dictionary and her cooking is really first rate. But, that's all you get is watching Giada. Thank god she is easy to understand and her recipes are easy to follow. But to get consistent results on some of the dishes, you should search the web and find the hard copies.  While Giada herself is great, this set is a waste of money. You're better off recording the shows and going to the web to get the recipes you want or, better yet, just stick with her cookbooks which are all first rate and worlds above this cheap presentation.</td>\n",

If you are purchasing this to INFORM for the first time about substance abuse and why it is difficult to \"just quit\", please choose another way.  This is overly long, meanders, imparts very little useful information, and lacks energy (I'm a therapist and it put ME to sleep). I don't think it would find a connection with an audience that is hungry for \"ah-hah\" moments and some insights into their loved one's problem.  It is basically four people (all middle aged Caucasians) sitting in a darkened room around a table asking each other what they think about a range of topics.  It could have been great--personal stories, professional insights, some science, etc., but kind of comes across as a sleepy, low budget afternoon interview show.  I will keep looking.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\"Why Don't They Just Quit\" could not hold my attention that I wouldn't even dare to bore my adult substance addiction therapy group with it. To show this to a population of substance abusers would put them to sleep. The kind of addiction films that stimulate my clients are the ones that explain how they got addicted, why they are addicted, and what can be done about it from a psychological, biological, and physiology perspective. Psychological, biological, and physiological films make them feel as if they are a person first with some issues, instead of making them feel they are labeled as a problem with the identity of an alcoholic or addict (a person second) in which this DVD takes that position. Good addiction films today move fast, scene to scene, with music in background and people talking scene to scene with speed. This DVD has the same two or four people sitting around a table talking about \"the alcoholic or drug user\" with the same monotone voices. The background is black and has a bowl of fruit to look at on the table but doesn't even have something to look at in the background such as cars going by in a window or pictures or a bookshelf. This DVD definitely isn't for substance user/abuser audience or a therapist that already has knowledge about addictions. It is more suited for those that don't know anything about addictions and who doesn't have substance-using issues. I would recommend this DVD for family members experiencing a love one with using issues or a student first learning about addictions for their studies in the mental health or medical field because the DVD pretty much covers all the basics A to Z about understanding a person with alcohol or drug issues. I also recommend, to really get to know what a substance user is experiencing is to attend a few AA and/or NA speaker night meetings to hear how they journeyed through their recovery process.</td>\n",

He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This film is, without a doubt, a Christian perspective on the Joseph story. Or as one of your reviewers commented, there are messianic threads cleverly interwoven throughout. For example, nowhere in the old testament does Jacob EVER say that he gives his inheritance to Joseph. This is an obvious suggestion that Jesus, descended from the tribe of Joseph (and whose nominal \"father\" is Joseph)is to inherit Gods blessings, with Christians inheriting the covenant of the Israelites. And the scene of Joseph imprisoned in the Pharaoh's prison saying to God \"why have you forsaken me\" is NOWHERE mentioned in the old testament; it is strictly put in to provide a Christian slant. Toward the end of the movie, when Joseph goes to see his father, there is a scene in which a large number of crosses appear (briefly). And incidentally, when Joseph and his father meet, the former is shown bowing down to the latter. However, as is clearly stated in the old testament, when Joseph has his dream in which the sun, moon and the stars bow before him, for this dream to be fulfilled (as are all the others in the Joseph story), Jacob (the sun) must bow down to Joseph, not the reverse. I don't have a problem with Christian Messianic films, and I in fact saw this on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, but before everyone falls all over themselves saying what a saintly film this is, please, recognise that it has been made with a specific point of view in mind, namely Christianity, and that there are other perspectives on the Joseph story that are quite different.  I think that some honesty on this subject would raise this film above the level of Christian propaganda.</td>\n",

       "2    I have to admit that I am a fan of Giada's cooking and I had great expectations when I ordered this set. They were however, crushed. While I still love Giada's cooking, this set is just a way for Food Network to make money. They really cheated with these DVD's. All they have are the video from the show, no text recipes, no link to the on line shows and no computer support. They play in Windows media player but the set does not contain the recipes. You can get more by taping the shows and then going to the web to download recipes. Another disappointment is the so so transfer quality to DVD. Perhaps I've been spoiled by HD and Tivo but the older shows I've recorded have had better playback quality than the episodes on the DVD's. It is in the old 480p but the quality of the transfer to DVD is dark and about the same quality as your average old VHS tape, not DVD quality. I get the impression Food Network got cheap and subbed out the DVD transfer to the lowest bidder (China?) and it shows.I could watch Giada read the dictionary and her cooking is really first rate. But, that's all you get is watching Giada. Thank god she is easy to understand and her recipes are easy to follow. But to get consistent results on some of the dishes, you should search the web and find the hard copies.  While Giada herself is great, this set is a waste of money. You're better off recording the shows and going to the web to get the recipes you want or, better yet, just stick with her cookbooks which are all first rate and worlds above this cheap presentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "8    I, too, purchased this to use with my patients in early recovery, an ethnically mixed urban/suburban population who complain that their families, friends,s.o.'s \"don't get it\".  If you are purchasing this to INFORM for the first time about substance abuse and why it is difficult to \"just quit\", please choose another way.  This is overly long, meanders, imparts very little useful information, and lacks energy (I'm a therapist and it put ME to sleep). I don't think it would find a connection with an audience that is hungry for \"ah-hah\" moments and some insights into their loved one's problem.  It is basically four people (all middle aged Caucasians) sitting in a darkened room around a table asking each other what they think about a range of topics.  It could have been great--personal stories, professional insights, some science, etc., but kind of comes across as a sleepy, low budget afternoon interview show.  I will keep looking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "30   \"Why Don't They Just Quit\" could not hold my attention that I wouldn't even dare to bore my adult substance addiction therapy group with it. To show this to a population of substance abusers would put them to sleep. The kind of addiction films that stimulate my clients are the ones that explain how they got addicted, why they are addicted, and what can be done about it from a psychological, biological, and physiology perspective. Psychological, biological, and physiological films make them feel as if they are a person first with some issues, instead of making them feel they are labeled as a problem with the identity of an alcoholic or addict (a person second) in which this DVD takes that position. Good addiction films today move fast, scene to scene, with music in background and people talking scene to scene with speed. This DVD has the same two or four people sitting around a table talking about \"the alcoholic or drug user\" with the same monotone voices. The background is black and has a bowl of fruit to look at on the table but doesn't even have something to look at in the background such as cars going by in a window or pictures or a bookshelf. This DVD definitely isn't for substance user/abuser audience or a therapist that already has knowledge about addictions. It is more suited for those that don't know anything about addictions and who doesn't have substance-using issues. I would recommend this DVD for family members experiencing a love one with using issues or a student first learning about addictions for their studies in the mental health or medical field because the DVD pretty much covers all the basics A to Z about understanding a person with alcohol or drug issues. I also recommend, to really get to know what a substance user is experiencing is to attend a few AA and/or NA speaker night meetings to hear how they journeyed through their recovery process.   \n",
       "371  Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "443  This film is, without a doubt, a Christian perspective on the Joseph story. Or as one of your reviewers commented, there are messianic threads cleverly interwoven throughout. For example, nowhere in the old testament does Jacob EVER say that he gives his inheritance to Joseph. This is an obvious suggestion that Jesus, descended from the tribe of Joseph (and whose nominal \"father\" is Joseph)is to inherit Gods blessings, with Christians inheriting the covenant of the Israelites. And the scene of Joseph imprisoned in the Pharaoh's prison saying to God \"why have you forsaken me\" is NOWHERE mentioned in the old testament; it is strictly put in to provide a Christian slant. Toward the end of the movie, when Joseph goes to see his father, there is a scene in which a large number of crosses appear (briefly). And incidentally, when Joseph and his father meet, the former is shown bowing down to the latter. However, as is clearly stated in the old testament, when Joseph has his dream in which the sun, moon and the stars bow before him, for this dream to be fulfilled (as are all the others in the Joseph story), Jacob (the sun) must bow down to Joseph, not the reverse. I don't have a problem with Christian Messianic films, and I in fact saw this on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, but before everyone falls all over themselves saying what a saintly film this is, please, recognise that it has been made with a specific point of view in mind, namely Christianity, and that there are other perspectives on the Joseph story that are quite different.  I think that some honesty on this subject would raise this film above the level of Christian propaganda.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

None of the other reviews or descriptions advise you of the format.Had I known this I would not have ordered it on Blu-ray. I did and it's not that important to return it within the 30 days as it does add to my Scrooge collection.I will not prattle on about A Christmas Carol.

Probably wouldn't have bought this if I'd known all this above purchasing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "      <td>I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.  Oh well, great movie.</td>\n",

One will actually forget that he was 'The FONZ' and will be amazed at his transformation from nice guy to mean guy back to nice guy. The general feel of this movie, though, is grey. That's the best way to describe it. But then, it was a bleak grey time in American history, with the Great Depression and all. When Dickens originally wrote the book, it was a grey time in England's history as well, so the subdued feeling one gets while watching this 'modern' version fits in well with the spirit of the original story.A nice twist (sorry, Oliver!) to a true classic.By the way, for my money, the finest original version out there is the George C.

You'll love it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "137  Reproduction is first rate. Limited extras but interesting. I think the original production was on par with other TV movies of the time. The adaption of A Christmas Carol to a Depression era setting was well done. Henry Winkler is excellent in portraying the bitter  old man. If you have a Christmas DVD collection, like me, this belongs in it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "191  I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.  Oh well, great movie.   \n",
       "217  Henry Winkler proves his acting ability in this American version of the Dickens classic. One will actually forget that he was 'The FONZ' and will be amazed at his transformation from nice guy to mean guy back to nice guy. The general feel of this movie, though, is grey. That's the best way to describe it. But then, it was a bleak grey time in American history, with the Great Depression and all. When Dickens originally wrote the book, it was a grey time in England's history as well, so the subdued feeling one gets while watching this 'modern' version fits in well with the spirit of the original story.A nice twist (sorry, Oliver!) to a true classic.By the way, for my money, the finest original version out there is the George C. Scott version followed closely by Alistair Sim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I find watching Ina Garten cook in her kitchen very relaxing after a hectic day.  SHE is doing the cooking, not me.  SHE is having to clean up, not me.  Of course we all know she has a team to do all the prep work and clean up, but we can pretend, can't we? Lots of her earlier episodes with lots of food and friends. Lemon cakes, shrimp dishes, brownies, salads, entrees. I recently made her Szechuan Noodles and the first bowl cost me $40! That's 'cause I didn't have any of the ingredients you need to make it! But once you splurge on all the condiments, you're home free.  I have eaten Szechuan Noodles all week! I can't get enough of her recipe. Hot, cold, warm. They are SO good! That recipe is on the DVD as well. She isn't cutesy like a lot of the Food Network people.  I really dislike that.  Cute doesn't work for me.  I want someone with substance who knows what she's doing. Ina Garten is that gal. You can buy them new, like I did, or used.  Just get them both! You will find yourself in your kitchen at odd hours of the night cooking something! They're addictive. Hope she comes out with Volumes 3, 4 and on.</td>\n",

       "3   I bought these two volumes new and spent over $50 doing so.  You get two DVDs with three discs in each. Why would I buy DVDs if I have the cookbooks? I find watching Ina Garten cook in her kitchen very relaxing after a hectic day.  SHE is doing the cooking, not me.  SHE is having to clean up, not me.  Of course we all know she has a team to do all the prep work and clean up, but we can pretend, can't we? Lots of her earlier episodes with lots of food and friends. Lemon cakes, shrimp dishes, brownies, salads, entrees. I recently made her Szechuan Noodles and the first bowl cost me $40! That's 'cause I didn't have any of the ingredients you need to make it! But once you splurge on all the condiments, you're home free.  I have eaten Szechuan Noodles all week! I can't get enough of her recipe. Hot, cold, warm. They are SO good! That recipe is on the DVD as well. She isn't cutesy like a lot of the Food Network people.  I really dislike that.  Cute doesn't work for me.  I want someone with substance who knows what she's doing. Ina Garten is that gal. You can buy them new, like I did, or used.  Just get them both! You will find yourself in your kitchen at odd hours of the night cooking something! They're addictive. Hope she comes out with Volumes 3, 4 and on.   \n",
       "5   I have read many books and literature written on addiction and recovery, and the ones I find the most informative and helpful to those seeking knowledge and understanding are the ones written from individuals who have been there themselves. The school of hard knocks is I believe to be the best education and insights into how and what an addict thinks and acts comes from those who have been there from traditional education. I believe Joe Herzank's personal knowledge and insights. I recommend this DVD to anyone struggling with addiction. Thank God for those like Joe Herzank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "7   I have read the original Why Don't They Just Quit and have reviewed the DVD roundtable. I appreciate the talk being so frank and uncomplicated for anyone who is just beginning the &#34;Addiction walk&#34; most specifically as a heartbroken family member. This is a difficult time for everyone. Even if the entire book/DVD doesn't address all of the readers/viewers needs it is well worth the financial investment to buy this product. I was so impressed with its contents, I contributed my own money to the Herzaneks so extra books could be purchased and distributed to those who couldn't afford them.

       "11  My 18 year old grandson has been addicted to drugs and running amok for the past 4 years. The heartaches are huge. I feel it was divine guidance for me to \"happen upon\" Joe's book and Video discussion of Why Don't They Just Quit?  The book and discussion was not only informative but so filled with hope that eventually anyone can quit if that is the choice they make. I gave the book to my grandson and he was inspired by the book. It brought comfort to me, Adam's Mom and others in the family who are struggling. It isn't over yet so this book provides us with a good roadmap from others who have travelled this road and have struggled with this issue before us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
