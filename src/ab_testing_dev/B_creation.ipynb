I also did not give it five stars because it would have been nice to have the \"her ghost in the fog\" video on here, and finally I thin Dani could have done better on some parts of the songs. For example: On \"her ghost in the fog\" (live version), he chooses to growl in that typical death metal voice, instead of talking in the deep gothic voice like he does on the album. By using this growly voice, I think he is cheese'n off some of the songs best parts. Anyway, these are minor gripes and this is a must have DVD, so definitely BUY IT!...</td>\n",

In the style of Napoleon Dynamite describing a Liger, I would say \"...they're pretty much my favorite band.\"  Their music is among the worst in the industry, they suck in a way few bands can meaningfully aspire to.  I've seen them live, bought pretty much every t-shirt from every album and tour, and have almost every album that they've released over the last \"decade and a bit\".  I love it, I love it all.  I recently purchased Heavy, Left-Handed, &amp; Candid.  If you don't like Cradle of Filth, then you'll most certainly hate this DVD.  It's absolutely fantastic, full of everything I was hoping for.There is a bunch of documentary type stuff, eleven live performances, a couple of music videos, and a few other \"shorts\" put together by the band.  Another one of the bonus items they threw on the disc is a short movie called \"The Blair Twit Project\".  This is basically footage of the band walking through woodland, filmed entirely using the night-vision mode on a video camera as they follow the trail of \"a pissed northern bastard.\"  Being a \"northerner\" myself, it felt very much like a standard night walking home from the pub on a Friday night being idiots.  It's funny to watch *once*.The DVD is actually really well put together and there is a ton of material included, which is a refreshing change when compared to some other music DVDs I've bought that barely even take the time to put a decent menu together.  As with their music, most people will hate this DVD.  I loved it, but then again, I'm weird.  The live performances are pretty awesome and it has solidified my decision to have to see this band again soon.  I don't know if they come to the US very often if at all, but some guy in Hot Topic assured me that he'd seen them here a few years ago.  I'll have to keep my eyes on the tour dates.  Then the hardest job will be convincing anyone to actually go with me.  My wife say's she's up for it, but I think that will have to be seen to be believed.</td>\n",

His character is so complex, and there's so many things that I pick up on in his performance when I rewatch this movie.  I didn't really know how to fit these thoughts into my review, so I thought I would just point it out right away.  That quote above is classic rambling from Lau Ching Wan's character.  I don't know how I didn't get annoyed of his character, but Lau Ching Wan just gives such a great performance.  I kept wanting to hear what he had to say, because the more he rambles on, the more violent he gets with his words.  Great stuff.Lau Ching Wan stars as a gangster who just got out of jail, and right away he gets into a fight.  After his brawl he decides to stay at a really cheap inn run by a poor widow played by Ruby Wong.  They slowly begin a relationship, and I found it well done and touching.  Lau Ching Wan's character is over the top with how rude he is, but he does a great job at it.  I really found myself liking his character, even though his character is supposed to be almost completely unlikeable.  One scene I liked was when Lau Ching Wan literally forces the owner of the inn and her son to go out and have a day of fun with him.  It is quite an odd scene.  So they go out for the day, and do all types of fun things.  For instance Lau Ching Wan shows them what part of a wall he painted while he was in prison. But seriously, there are a lot of good things about this movie.  There's one hilarious scene where Lau throws a big fit screaming at the inn owner that his room has been taken.  He couldn't have been a bigger baby.  She doesn't say a word, politely shows him to his room, and when the door opens, the drunken Lau Ching Wan figures out after a few seconds that he must have been in the wrong room before.  Such a great scene.  There's some more scenes like that, and that's the main reason the movie is worth watching.  Plus you have those great small touches that Johnnie To is known for.  Like when the inn owner is cleaning Lau's room, she sees a big pile of money in his drawer, and she shuts the drawer right away.  Good scene with good character development for both actors.  But then what Johnnie To does is expand on it.  About 4 days pass, and she is cleaning his room, and once again sees his drawer open, but this time that big pile of money is nothing but a few bills.  Like I said, it's just a small touch.While this movie isn't that exciting, and it's anything but original, I loved the directing job, the acting, dialogue,  the short action scenes, and I found myself laughing outloud at least a few times.  Lau Ching Wan + Johnnie To.  How can you go wrong with that?  You can't.  And you also have Lam Suet giving a great performance.  This is back when he actually got good roles.  Nowadays it seems like he just gets really small roles or cameos in Johnnie To movies.  Don't expect a great thriller or something really exciting, just an enjoyable movie.Rating- 4/5The subtitles on the Universe DVD are well written, but they go by a bit too fast most of the time.  Sound is good.  5.1 and 3.0 Cantonese and Mandarin tracks.  And the picture quality isn't exactly HD, but still very good.</td>\n",

She's more of a solid, consistent performer than a blow-you-away performer, but that's hardly a bad thing.  She comes alive onstage and brings a warmth and joy to her performances that her best records can only hint at.  (Not that she doesn't make consistently records--she does.)This 1995 performance tape (and you have to keep in mind that it was originally VHS) captures her and her band at their best.  Yes, the sound could be better, but even in an actual performance setting, you might find yourself complaining about the acoustics a bit.  If the performance is solid, you can begin to overlook a few sound problems. So too with this DVD.Guests like Jackson Browne, Ruth Brown and Charles Brown and even some non-Brown(e)s like Kim Wilson and Bryan Adams add to the special event quality of the performance. And Bruce Hornsby adds his distinctive piano to a couple of numbers.  (\"I Can't Make You Love Me\" is particularly affecting.) But my favorite numbers are those featuring  Bonnie and her great band.  The chemistry between them is palpable.She ain't no amoeba.</td>\n",

A lot of the time the music and film are out of sync, but what is worse is that more than once shots belonging to an other part of the concert are used to fill up gaps elsewhere. I cannot believe that the editor actually thinks that the viewer is stupid enough to fall for these cheap solutions. The mistakes are often so obvious! It is not enough to show, let's say, a drummer who is drumming. NO! We want to see that that drummer is actually playing that particular part of the music that is coming from our speakers at that particular moment.Still, as I said, the concert is great, and the DVD is worth 4 stars; a must have for all her fans.</td>\n",

What a musical performance!  And this woman who commented on the bare-chested guys in the audience (what audacity!).  I have to be honest--haven't followed every recording of her career.  But everytime I hear her I'm floored.  Here's a woman who can belt out a ballad, play the blues, and put the most loving touch on a folk song, to bring you to tears.  Versatility is Raitt.  You want proof!?  Just see her on the Stevie Ray Vaughan tribute belting out &amp;quot;Pride and Joy.&amp;quot;  She takes a guy song and makes it into the quintessential girl's torch song!  All I can say is she made a lot of guys lonely (including me!) when she mentions a husband in the concert.  But hey, we are happy for you Bonnie.But what a minute!  The production on this video just doesn't do Bonnie justice.  I've heard much about the audio problems, and I agree.  But the video doesn't give us fans a chance!  I want something more than 5 seconds of a sustained shot on Bonnie and her guitar.  The music is there, but a bit more of Bonnie, without endless cuts to her band, would be desirable.  (A great band mind you, but nonetheless it couldn't hurt to let us see her a bit more!)I would love to see Bonnie in a proper DVD.  How about it Bonnie!  There're plenty of us out here that would love to hear from you.  You are a legend now, like BB and Buddy.  Put your music on record (in resplendent DVD)!  I'll be waiting.</td>\n",

We just get snippets of great songs and rare concert footage, and there isn't any interviews or commentary with the rest of the band (save for Linda's posthumous comments) especially from loyal, talented, long-suffering Denny Laine who was there from start to finish.  DVD extras include an additional 22 minute discussion between Paul and Mary, promotional videos for &amp;quot;Jet&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Let 'Em In&amp;quot; (which were both taken from the &amp;quot;Rockshow&amp;quot; film) and the superstar jam &amp;quot;Rockestra&amp;quot;.

I suspect McCartney and his daughter intended to make a documentary about Wings but ended up with one about Paul and Linda instead.  But that's okay, although they should have changed the name of the DVD.The best feature of Wingspan is that Paul, for once, is remarkably articulate in the interview sections.  The questions are more intimate than you might expect from his own daughter, too.  It can't have been easy for him to talk with her about such issues as the drug bust in Japan - but he does it, apparently quite honestly.  I also loved the early films and stories of the retreat in Scotland immediately before and after the Beatles broke up, and the first Wings tour.  The shots of the 1976 American tour are also terrific - if there's enough footage of those shows for a full-length DVD, everyone who sees this will want to buy it.  Just sayin', guys.  While most fans will already know some of the stories he tells, there are several here that I've never heard before, notably the origin of \"Mrs. Vanderbilt\" and the reggae bridge in \"Live and Let Die.\"  I also came away with a lot more respect for Linda after watching this, even if the fact remains that she couldn't sing.What's not so good is the discussion of the other members of Wings and the band's work as a whole - which, after all, is apparently what the show was supposed to be about in the first place.  With occasional exceptions, the talk about the songs is fairly cursory, and this is even more true when it comes to the musicians.  Denny Laine, the only constant member of Wings besides Paul and Linda (and, on two occasions, the only other member of the band) doesn't get anywhere near the screen time he warrants.  Some of the other members literally only get one mention in passing.  Then again, that is an accurate reflection of how long they were in the group!  Their best-selling album, \"Wings at the Speed of Sound,\" isn't discussed at all and only about a minute's worth of it is even used as background music.  (I can't help wondering if this is Paul and Mary's way of acknowledging that, big as it was, it's not a very good album.)  During the segment on the 1976 tour, he recites a rather obnoxious nursery rhyme he made up in response to questions about a Beatles reunion - without ever mentioning that Ringo turned up at one of the shows and he seemed quite happy about it at the time.  I'd love to know why he left that out.Overall, the good outweighs the bad.  Now, let's see about a full-length Wings concert DVD...</td>\n",

       "      <td>For this \"rockumentary,\" Paul McCartney is interviewed by his daughter. He is very playful and relaxed, given his familiarity with the interviewer. At the beginning of the program we witness the dissolution of the Beatles and the marriage of Paul and Linda. Interestingly, none of the other Beatles were in attendance at the hastily arranged nuptials. Later, Paul wonders if he can make it as a solo artist. After releasing a couple of solo albums, he decides to form a new band. His wife Linda would be a member of the group, even though she had little musical experience. Paul admired Denny Laine's guitar playing and singing with the Moody Blues.  Denny was asked to join his new group Wings. As it turned out, Denny Laine was the ONLY member of Wings to stay with the group from start to finish, other than Linda. However, his musical contributions - what songs he wrote and sang on, or contributed a guitar solo to - are never discussed. Mr. Laine was not interviewed for this DVD, nor are any clips of old interviews with him included. Other band members are only mentioned in passing although, to be fair, most only lasted with Wings a short time.As Paul said near the end of the program, he proved that he could have major hits and successful world tours with another band after the Beatles. After Paul's infamous drug bust in Japan, he felt that it was time to give everything a rest. Thus Wings ended, not with a bang but with a whimper. Surprisingly, there is no booklet or even an insert included with the DVD. The extras include complete live performances of two songs - \"Jet\" and \"Let 'Em In\" - as well as the studio session for the instrumental \"Rockestra.\" The discography contains mistakes; when you click on the song list for \"Wings Over America\" it displays the song list for \"Wings At The Speed Of Sound.\" A little more attention to detail and interviews with other band members could easily have made this a 5 star DVD.</td>\n",

Although initially he has little respect for the native Inuit tribes who inhabit the land, he learns the skills that he needs to survive from a young Inuit woman who teaches him how to fish and hunt, how to stitch animal skins into clothing and boots, how to stay alive in a frigid and hostile environment.

Very good development of a relationship when the individuals are from different societies and who do not speak the same language  yet must work together to survive. There were no polar bear or wolf attacks, just the cold,wet, hunger and approaching winter. Make some hot chocolate and snuggle in to celebrate your cozy home!</td>\n",

A little too raunchy for my taste and certainly didn't make the group of pilots look very good.  Pretty much all of them were foul-mouthed, money-grubbing and drunk womanizers who live in filthy houses or apartments, but, after the movie got off the ground, it really took off (pun intended).The whole story is beautifully told after that beginning and the photography and directing (Charles Martin Smith) is stunning.  Annabella Piugattuk is wonderful to watch and Barry Pepper did a terrific job too.I have seen this movie before and would recommend it without hesitation to anyone.</td>\n",

       "1      This episode pretty much has Hafron and Emmanuelle teleporting to different parts of the world and &quot;doing it&quot;. There is the continuing plot from an earlier episode of some group on Earth trying to track them down. That's the main reason for Emmanuelle and Hafron to jump to different parts of the world. Otherwise, this episode is mostly sex scenes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2      This is an intimate concert of Robert Mirabal.  Although I thought that it was, as I said, masterful, the sound, at times sounded a little muffled.The storytelling of the songs gave an insight of native culture and of Mirabal's own family stories and history.The Dance and Ee You Oo are my picks for the best songs, but they are all a joy to watch.

       "4      Great show from the inventors of the extreme gothic metal genre !! 75'of pure mayhem with good visuals and a great sound, although the vocals are a little high in the mix for my taste and the guitar on the right channel is 10 times louder than the one on the left so I ended up switching it to mono to even things up. It's hard to give this more stars esp. when you've watched the PTSFirepower DVD first like I did, that one is so much better. The 5 bonus videoclips totally rule and round up the package making the purchase a worthy one.Now the mockumentary may not be suited to everyone's tastes, personally it bored me and know of a lot of people who feels it ruins the band's image. Well don't watch it then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "5      I rented this dvd, i didnt buy it.  I also rented PanDamonAeon and Mannequin.  This dvd has excellent very long concert footage.  Its practically the same songs as on Livebait for the Dead.  And then we have the rest of the dvd.  Im sorry, i love CoF but that \"schockumentary\" thing was just sad.  I could barely stand to watch it.  It's stupid and boring, maybe if theyd shown more of the band in a more coherent manner...and it just goes on and on forever.  This is a 2 hour plus dvd adn half of it is crap.  The \"blair twit Project\" is slightly amusing, but mostly boring.  The music videos are good though.  I would still recommend buying this dvd just for the music videos and the concert footage.  PanDamonAeon gave me more joy though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "6      Excellent Sound, Excellent Picture, Tons and Tons of songs. Love the Scorched Earth Erotic video. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't think they let their female singer sing enough, it adds a nice goth touch. I also did not give it five stars because it would have been nice to have the \"her ghost in the fog\" video on here, and finally I thin Dani could have done better on some parts of the songs. For example: On \"her ghost in the fog\" (live version), he chooses to growl in that typical death metal voice, instead of talking in the deep gothic voice like he does on the album. By using this growly voice, I think he is cheese'n off some of the songs best parts. Anyway, these are minor gripes and this is a must have DVD, so definitely BUY IT!...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "7      As most of my friends hate, I'm massively into Cradle of Filth.  In the style of Napoleon Dynamite describing a Liger, I would say \"...they're pretty much my favorite band.\"  Their music is among the worst in the industry, they suck in a way few bands can meaningfully aspire to.  I've seen them live, bought pretty much every t-shirt from every album and tour, and have almost every album that they've released over the last \"decade and a bit\".  I love it, I love it all.  I recently purchased Heavy, Left-Handed, & Candid.  If you don't like Cradle of Filth, then you'll most certainly hate this DVD.  It's absolutely fantastic, full of everything I was hoping for.There is a bunch of documentary type stuff, eleven live performances, a couple of music videos, and a few other \"shorts\" put together by the band.  Another one of the bonus items they threw on the disc is a short movie called \"The Blair Twit Project\".  This is basically footage of the band walking through woodland, filmed entirely using the night-vision mode on a video camera as they follow the trail of \"a pissed northern bastard.\"  Being a \"northerner\" myself, it felt very much like a standard night walking home from the pub on a Friday night being idiots.  It's funny to watch *once*.The DVD is actually really well put together and there is a ton of material included, which is a refreshing change when compared to some other music DVDs I've bought that barely even take the time to put a decent menu together.  As with their music, most people will hate this DVD.  I loved it, but then again, I'm weird.  The live performances are pretty awesome and it has solidified my decision to have to see this band again soon.  I don't know if they come to the US very often if at all, but some guy in Hot Topic assured me that he'd seen them here a few years ago.  I'll have to keep my eyes on the tour dates.  Then the hardest job will be convincing anyone to actually go with me.  My wife say's she's up for it, but I think that will have to be seen to be believed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "8      This category 3 classic mixes genres like only Hong Kong use to be able to do before the takeover. It over priced because of it's rarity so unless you collect rare Category 3 films you might want to get something else.

       "12     Wow, I thought I rambled, but Lau Ching wan takes it to another level!  His character is so complex, and there's so many things that I pick up on in his performance when I rewatch this movie.  I didn't really know how to fit these thoughts into my review, so I thought I would just point it out right away.  That quote above is classic rambling from Lau Ching Wan's character.  I don't know how I didn't get annoyed of his character, but Lau Ching Wan just gives such a great performance.  I kept wanting to hear what he had to say, because the more he rambles on, the more violent he gets with his words.  Great stuff.Lau Ching Wan stars as a gangster who just got out of jail, and right away he gets into a fight.  After his brawl he decides to stay at a really cheap inn run by a poor widow played by Ruby Wong.  They slowly begin a relationship, and I found it well done and touching.  Lau Ching Wan's character is over the top with how rude he is, but he does a great job at it.  I really found myself liking his character, even though his character is supposed to be almost completely unlikeable.  One scene I liked was when Lau Ching Wan literally forces the owner of the inn and her son to go out and have a day of fun with him.  It is quite an odd scene.  So they go out for the day, and do all types of fun things.  For instance Lau Ching Wan shows them what part of a wall he painted while he was in prison. But seriously, there are a lot of good things about this movie.  There's one hilarious scene where Lau throws a big fit screaming at the inn owner that his room has been taken.  He couldn't have been a bigger baby.  She doesn't say a word, politely shows him to his room, and when the door opens, the drunken Lau Ching Wan figures out after a few seconds that he must have been in the wrong room before.  Such a great scene.  There's some more scenes like that, and that's the main reason the movie is worth watching.  Plus you have those great small touches that Johnnie To is known for.  Like when the inn owner is cleaning Lau's room, she sees a big pile of money in his drawer, and she shuts the drawer right away.  Good scene with good character development for both actors.  But then what Johnnie To does is expand on it.  About 4 days pass, and she is cleaning his room, and once again sees his drawer open, but this time that big pile of money is nothing but a few bills.  Like I said, it's just a small touch.While this movie isn't that exciting, and it's anything but original, I loved the directing job, the acting, dialogue,  the short action scenes, and I found myself laughing outloud at least a few times.  Lau Ching Wan + Johnnie To.  How can you go wrong with that?  You can't.  And you also have Lam Suet giving a great performance.  This is back when he actually got good roles.  Nowadays it seems like he just gets really small roles or cameos in Johnnie To movies.  Don't expect a great thriller or something really exciting, just an enjoyable movie.Rating- 4/5The subtitles on the Universe DVD are well written, but they go by a bit too fast most of the time.  Sound is good.  5.1 and 3.0 Cantonese and Mandarin tracks.  And the picture quality isn't exactly HD, but still very good.   \n",
       "13     Killer is an okay HK film with a familiar storyline.  Jordan Chan is a well respected hitman who wants to go into legit businesses with his crooked homies.  However, he's trapped in the game and his world is starting to fall apart.  The performances are good and I really cared about the main characters.  Sexy Yoyo Mung is always a treat for my eyes and I was really surprised and thrilled to see Shaw Brothers veteran, Lo Meng as a rival mob boss.  I just wish there was a little more action.  Director Billy Chung should have asked Johnnie To for a few pointers.  With more action scenes and a better ending, this really could have been a Killer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "14     Loved it, terrible movie at it's core, but very appealing visually.  Shot well, funny, and slick.  As a fan of the horror genre (I'm of the Halloween and Friday the 13th generation) I'm used to seeing the girls in bikini/underwear/nothing for eyecandy.  This one finally gives the boys a turn, with the male lead jogging shirtless, bending and stretching in long camera shots, and showing off his nice assets.  The head vampire, who obviously adores him, is a hottie as well, and loves to hang out in his underwear with all his friends.  Recommended for a lonely Friday night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "15     Don't waste any time thinking where is the horror in that flick, fellas.The story of that low, 'low' budget movie is an excuse for delivering underwear homoerotic scenes of some of the most hot young males that the director could find when it shooted the movie.So, if you like any of this like i do, apart from expend a very entertaining corny one and a half hour of your life, there's a great chance that you really enjoy it.Personally, as an horror movies fan, i think that it's time to center the erotic interest of that movies in the males, after passing more than twenty years worshiping the body of women.Apparently, there's a lot of people agreeing with me. As an example, take a look at THE COVENANT, one major studio horror flick that is nothing more that a David Decoteau movie, but with a real 'budget' attached to itAfter all, yes; the movie is cheap.

       "18     Based on Hugh Wiley's inscrutable Oriental detective Mr. Wong, Boris Karloff is called upon by his detective friend to solve the murder of undercover detective Dan O'Grady that includes smuggling. James Lee Wong informs Capt. Bill Street (Grant Withers) that he can only help if it has something to do with the Orient.

       "22     I always make a point to see Bonnie Raitt live whenever I can. I've caught her in all kinds of venues and she's never disappointed.  She's more of a solid, consistent performer than a blow-you-away performer, but that's hardly a bad thing.  She comes alive onstage and brings a warmth and joy to her performances that her best records can only hint at.  (Not that she doesn't make consistently records--she does.)This 1995 performance tape (and you have to keep in mind that it was originally VHS) captures her and her band at their best.  Yes, the sound could be better, but even in an actual performance setting, you might find yourself complaining about the acoustics a bit.  If the performance is solid, you can begin to overlook a few sound problems. So too with this DVD.Guests like Jackson Browne, Ruth Brown and Charles Brown and even some non-Brown(e)s like Kim Wilson and Bryan Adams add to the special event quality of the performance. And Bruce Hornsby adds his distinctive piano to a couple of numbers.  (\"I Can't Make You Love Me\" is particularly affecting.) But my favorite numbers are those featuring  Bonnie and her great band.  The chemistry between them is palpable.She ain't no amoeba.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "23     Bonnie is one of my all time favorite artists. I was blown away by the Road Tested CD a few years ago and expected a lot from the DVD. The music, the sound, the stage, the lighting, the registration, the colors are all great indeed, but the editing is all wrong and annoying. A lot of the time the music and film are out of sync, but what is worse is that more than once shots belonging to an other part of the concert are used to fill up gaps elsewhere. I cannot believe that the editor actually thinks that the viewer is stupid enough to fall for these cheap solutions. The mistakes are often so obvious! It is not enough to show, let's say, a drummer who is drumming. NO! We want to see that that drummer is actually playing that particular part of the music that is coming from our speakers at that particular moment.Still, as I said, the concert is great, and the DVD is worth 4 stars; a must have for all her fans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "26     Let me start with a few words about Bonnie Raitt.  I first saw her at the Lenox Arts Center in MA in the early '70s, and it is one of those performances that sticks with you.  What a musical performance!  And this woman who commented on the bare-chested guys in the audience (what audacity!).  I have to be honest--haven't followed every recording of her career.  But everytime I hear her I'm floored.  Here's a woman who can belt out a ballad, play the blues, and put the most loving touch on a folk song, to bring you to tears.  Versatility is Raitt.  You want proof!?  Just see her on the Stevie Ray Vaughan tribute belting out &quot;Pride and Joy.&quot;  She takes a guy song and makes it into the quintessential girl's torch song!  All I can say is she made a lot of guys lonely (including me!) when she mentions a husband in the concert.  But hey, we are happy for you Bonnie.But what a minute!  The production on this video just doesn't do Bonnie justice.  I've heard much about the audio problems, and I agree.  But the video doesn't give us fans a chance!  I want something more than 5 seconds of a sustained shot on Bonnie and her guitar.  The music is there, but a bit more of Bonnie, without endless cuts to her band, would be desirable.  (A great band mind you, but nonetheless it couldn't hurt to let us see her a bit more!)I would love to see Bonnie in a proper DVD.  How about it Bonnie!  There're plenty of us out here that would love to hear from you.  You are a legend now, like BB and Buddy.  Put your music on record (in resplendent DVD)!  I'll be waiting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "27     In intimate conversation with daughter Mary (whose husband directed), Paul McCartney discusses life after the Beatles, and how his next challenge was to form a band, pack up the family, and hit the road.  88 minute film seen on ABC-TV is satisfying for fans but footage shown could have been expanded.  We just get snippets of great songs and rare concert footage, and there isn't any interviews or commentary with the rest of the band (save for Linda's posthumous comments) especially from loyal, talented, long-suffering Denny Laine who was there from start to finish.  DVD extras include an additional 22 minute discussion between Paul and Mary, promotional videos for &quot;Jet&quot; and &quot;Let 'Em In&quot; (which were both taken from the &quot;Rockshow&quot; film) and the superstar jam &quot;Rockestra&quot;.  Just three videos?  Also included is a discography and a photo gallery, with 100 pictures.  A neat package, but they should have alloted themselves more than 88 minutes to cover a nine-year career, especially with all the great music involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "28     The worst thing I can say about Wingspan is that the title is misleading.  I suspect McCartney and his daughter intended to make a documentary about Wings but ended up with one about Paul and Linda instead.  But that's okay, although they should have changed the name of the DVD.The best feature of Wingspan is that Paul, for once, is remarkably articulate in the interview sections.  The questions are more intimate than you might expect from his own daughter, too.  It can't have been easy for him to talk with her about such issues as the drug bust in Japan - but he does it, apparently quite honestly.  I also loved the early films and stories of the retreat in Scotland immediately before and after the Beatles broke up, and the first Wings tour.  The shots of the 1976 American tour are also terrific - if there's enough footage of those shows for a full-length DVD, everyone who sees this will want to buy it.  Just sayin', guys.  While most fans will already know some of the stories he tells, there are several here that I've never heard before, notably the origin of \"Mrs. Vanderbilt\" and the reggae bridge in \"Live and Let Die.\"  I also came away with a lot more respect for Linda after watching this, even if the fact remains that she couldn't sing.What's not so good is the discussion of the other members of Wings and the band's work as a whole - which, after all, is apparently what the show was supposed to be about in the first place.  With occasional exceptions, the talk about the songs is fairly cursory, and this is even more true when it comes to the musicians.  Denny Laine, the only constant member of Wings besides Paul and Linda (and, on two occasions, the only other member of the band) doesn't get anywhere near the screen time he warrants.  Some of the other members literally only get one mention in passing.  Then again, that is an accurate reflection of how long they were in the group!  Their best-selling album, \"Wings at the Speed of Sound,\" isn't discussed at all and only about a minute's worth of it is even used as background music.  (I can't help wondering if this is Paul and Mary's way of acknowledging that, big as it was, it's not a very good album.)  During the segment on the 1976 tour, he recites a rather obnoxious nursery rhyme he made up in response to questions about a Beatles reunion - without ever mentioning that Ringo turned up at one of the shows and he seemed quite happy about it at the time.  I'd love to know why he left that out.Overall, the good outweighs the bad.  Now, let's see about a full-length Wings concert DVD...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "29     For this \"rockumentary,\" Paul McCartney is interviewed by his daughter. He is very playful and relaxed, given his familiarity with the interviewer. At the beginning of the program we witness the dissolution of the Beatles and the marriage of Paul and Linda. Interestingly, none of the other Beatles were in attendance at the hastily arranged nuptials. Later, Paul wonders if he can make it as a solo artist. After releasing a couple of solo albums, he decides to form a new band. His wife Linda would be a member of the group, even though she had little musical experience. Paul admired Denny Laine's guitar playing and singing with the Moody Blues.  Denny was asked to join his new group Wings. As it turned out, Denny Laine was the ONLY member of Wings to stay with the group from start to finish, other than Linda. However, his musical contributions - what songs he wrote and sang on, or contributed a guitar solo to - are never discussed. Mr. Laine was not interviewed for this DVD, nor are any clips of old interviews with him included. Other band members are only mentioned in passing although, to be fair, most only lasted with Wings a short time.As Paul said near the end of the program, he proved that he could have major hits and successful world tours with another band after the Beatles. After Paul's infamous drug bust in Japan, he felt that it was time to give everything a rest. Thus Wings ended, not with a bang but with a whimper. Surprisingly, there is no booklet or even an insert included with the DVD. The extras include complete live performances of two songs - \"Jet\" and \"Let 'Em In\" - as well as the studio session for the instrumental \"Rockestra.\" The discography contains mistakes; when you click on the song list for \"Wings Over America\" it displays the song list for \"Wings At The Speed Of Sound.\" A little more attention to detail and interviews with other band members could easily have made this a 5 star DVD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "57570  To be honest, despite the large number of titles available in the Amazon Prime library, there are very few films in this collection that appeal to me. I was pleasantly surprised to find that The Snow Walker is an emotionally charged film about a greedy, homophobic, self-absorbed daredevil pilot whose plane crashes in the Arctic. Although initially he has little respect for the native Inuit tribes who inhabit the land, he learns the skills that he needs to survive from a young Inuit woman who teaches him how to fish and hunt, how to stitch animal skins into clothing and boots, how to stay alive in a frigid and hostile environment. The photography of the vast landscape is amazingly beautiful.

       "57582  I enjoyed the movie. It was a story that actually could have happened. The young man who lived a wild life redeemed himself when he cared for a sick young woman and she saved his life, too. An unlikely pair who ended up helping one another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "57583  Overall a great movie with some great scenes depicting raw nature. Acting is well done. A few scenes were a little slow but overall this was a great movie although it could have ended in a better way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "57584  I have never heard of this movie. Noticed it was on Prime and decided to watch it. It was surprisingly good. It's these small films that are the real gems. A wonderful film about nature/humans/survival/and cultural respect. If you want to watch an uplifting movie, I highly encourage this movie. The actor and actress are wonderful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "57585  This is a Canadian production, which was very well done. The story was set around the two main characters, both of whom were outstanding. An interesting and uplifting story - too bad the US film industry has to rely on violence, sex and ridiculous action themes for most of our productions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "57589  Survival in the far north.The film is essentially two people trying to survive the elements -a cocky bush pilot and a lovely young First Nation woman who is ill. Very good development of a relationship when the individuals are from different societies and who do not speak the same language  yet must work together to survive. There were no polar bear or wolf attacks, just the cold,wet, hunger and approaching winter.

       "57597  The only problem I had with this movie and the reason for not giving it five stars was the beginning.  A little too raunchy for my taste and certainly didn't make the group of pilots look very good.  Pretty much all of them were foul-mouthed, money-grubbing and drunk womanizers who live in filthy houses or apartments, but, after the movie got off the ground, it really took off (pun intended).The whole story is beautifully told after that beginning and the photography and directing (Charles Martin Smith) is stunning.  Annabella Piugattuk is wonderful to watch and Barry Pepper did a terrific job too.I have seen this movie before and would recommend it without hesitation to anyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "57598  It was a good movie showing the harshness of Alaska, and the human spirit to keep going.

The gun fights are nothing to winch at but, lack the extreme effects and graphic (to date) to make you feel you are there. If only it could have a bigger budget to expand on some areas and added little touches. The movie follows the book very closely, which makes for a very great entertainment. An Grade A example of why the military spends so much money on equipment today. This movie is a must for any fan that is looking for a Sean Bean collection. Which makes it a must for any historian or military \"buff\". Very well written both in book and movie. The locations are very well scouted and whole military attitude is very accurate. Sean Bean is great as both the lead and main character. A must watch for the escape and evasion of Britain's finest military professionals alone. The actors display a grace under fire type of attitude even during capture that is for the military personnel to exemplify. Gripping, exciting filled with real life type of situation.</td>\n",

This is the standard set-up for a Gothic film (think THE SHINING, the orginal HAUNTING, the first ALIEN), but the unusualness of the hospital, the exceptionally fine performances, and the sophisticated script set this in nearly as high the same class as those aforementioned Gothic classics. The cinematography is exceptionally and beautifully creepy. The actual abandoned Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts is a fantastic Gothic revival pile of a building; it is mostrously oversized, larger than you'd think any such building would have a right to be, and makes an absolutely wonderful setting for this very sophisticated Gothic chiller. Four workers on a hazmat team have one week to remove the asbestos and other hazardous waste products from the abandoned state hospital, with its miles of ugly rotting corridors and empty rooms; by the end of the film there are fewer of the team than when we started.</td>\n",

I'm not going to give away any of the plot, watch it for yourself!Beware that this particular version will not play in a standard U.S. DVD player. But if you happen to have a machine that will play it, this is the edition to get. While fullscreen they clearly surpass the American releases of these films I've seen around, some of which dont even have chapter menus and most of which have atrocious cover art. While it is unfortunately presented full screen (hence 4 stars vesrsus 5), the print and sound are good. If you have a multi-region player, buy with confidence. It seems that many of these old Corman films such as The Big Bird Cage, The Big Dollhouse, Women in Cages and The Arena are not availabe in widescreen, so until that day when they are, I say that these Australian releases from Umbrella Entertainment are the way to go. Some people find much to fault with these old Women in Prison flicks or Exploitation movies in general, and I'll grant that they are not always cinematically great, but in the case of Jack Hill, I think all his movies deserve to be watched if for no other reason than that they are extremely fun. The main character who isnt Pam Grier or Sid Haig is a one time Barker Beauty. Once again the great Jack Hill puts Pam Grier and Sid Haig in major roles and comes out with a winner.

Then again, this movie could be considered a \"niche\" movie, as many younger people who are part of the current hip-hop generation would have a tough time appreciating it. Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston (both of whom are very good actors, and somewhat underrated) turn in good performances.The soundtrack is, in a word, phenomenal. It also is obviously targeting the 80s metal crowd as its audience. For their efforts alone, this movie gets points.One could say that \"Rock Star\" was overlooked at the box office. \"Rock Star\" is a movie that recreates the hard rock era that was the 1980s. There are several original songs recorded by the members of the fictional Steel Dragon band represented in the film. In fact, many of the musicians who recorded the original songs portray their fictional counterparts in the movie. Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne's band, Black Label Society), Jason Bonham (who pounded the skins for his own band, Bonham, as well as being the son of legendary Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham), Jeff Pilson (Dokken), among others, were recruited to bring this band's music to life. Bands of all types of metal (from pop to death) benefited from the popularity that metal experienced during that time, and this movie helps recreate that time for people (like myself) who were young then, and are thankful that they grew up during those years.By now, almost everyone knows that this movie is loosely based on Tim \"Ripper\" Owens of Judas Priest fame, but it doesn't draw heavily from his real-life story.</td>\n",

It is one of the best and highest you will ever see. It features one of the best matches you will ever see and the last time the WWF had a PPV were RAW and Smackdown did not have separate rosters.1. A lot of people did not enjoy this match, but I thought it was great. It was a great Wrestlemania, not one of the better ones, but still the best. It could have been better, but too much focus was on Triple H and Stepahie. The crowd was kind of out of it, but it was a good match. Most notably is the Hogan/Warrior match from Wrestlemania VI in its entirety.Buy this DVD just for the Hogan/Rock match. But, I thought it was probably the third or fourth best PPV of the year. Triple H vs. Chris Jericho (Undisputed Title)Good match, not one of the better Wrestlemania main events, but still good nonetheless. The crowd makes this match even more entertaining. Rob Van Dam (Intercontinental Title)Pretty good way to start off the show. Jazz vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus (Women's Title/Triple Threat)I am not a fan of women's matches, but this one was pretty decent. The match has a good pace to it and a strong finish with a lot of close falls. These two mixed well together or maybe it is just Angle making everybody look good. It was kind of a stupid set up. It was a great match. Great action, and strong finish. Ric Flair vs. Undertaker (No DQ)Great match. Match of the year in my opinion. Good match featuring a mixture of styles. Great finish that features a run in by Arn Anderson. Kurt Angle vs. KaneVery good, underrated match. Great match. Words can't even describe how great this match is. D-Von takes a good bump off the turnbuckle and through a table. Edge vs. Booker TThis match stemmed from the stupid angle involving the hair shampoo commercial. Hardy Boys vs. Dudley's vs. Billy &amp; Chuck vs. APA (Tag Title/Fatal Fourway Elimination)Another very good match. This match would actually keep going on throughout the night featuring a number of wrestlers: Crash Holly, Spike Dudley, Mighty Molly, The Hurricane, and Christian.

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Christian (European Title)This match resulted from DDP trying to help Christian stop throwing temper tantrums and Christian in turn, turning his back on DDP. Pretty good match, although Booker T has lost a step from his WCW days. Good finish between the final two teams. Kevin Nash gets involved heavily in the match. Good backdrop from one announce table to the next by Jerico on Triple H.  Good ending. (8/10)This is actually a 2 disc set, with a lot of extra features. The crowd was really on RVD's side. There is a lot of blood in the match. Unfortunately, this PPV was criticized by many people. (7/10)11. He slides halfway across the ring. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Scott HallAnother match that was overlooked. Watch the ref slide into the ring when one of the refs is out. The crowd goes crazy. What the heck was the WWF thinking.</td>\n",

This has to be one of the worst films ever made, but if you sit down to watch it knowing that and ready to laugh, it's worth your time.Imagine Highlander made by a freshman film student, with some of his friends and/or random people off the street reading lines they have never read before, with a budget that consists solely of change found in said freshman's furniture, and you'll have scratched the surface of how amateurish, campy, and unintentionally hilarious this movie is.Lorenzo Lamas's hair alone demands viewing, as does the opening scene, wherein a guy (ostensibly a \"demon\") is standing on a wall, straight out from a wall... and there, as clear as the agony on your face, is the wire holding him up. It makes Leonard Part Six look like Citizen Kane, Gigli look like Seven Samurai, Showgirls look like Casablanca, and Episode II look like Episode V.  It's that bad, and revels in it.God bless you, Lorenzo Lamas.

I grew up watching both this version of Land of the Lost, thanks to my dad, as well as the 1990s remake. I honestly think that the original was a lot better, especially considering how much earlier it was made (the 1970s). This version features some great scripts by respected science-fiction authors such as Larry Niven, David Gerrold, DC Fontana, and Ben Bova. They enter a closed universe, which is just a term that means you can move in any direction and you will come right back to your starting point eventually. The episode \"Circle\" is an especially good one, adding much better continuity to the series.Sure, the effects were cheesy. But it was a Saturday morning kid's show during the 1970s. There is even a point at which the family sees themselves while looking at a far-away point with their binoculars. I was much more interested in the overarching plot, and understanding how this strange \"Land of the Lost\" worked. I think we can forgive the claymation dinosaurs.

       "      <td>It is a tremendous piece of work and deserves far more honor than it received.All that said about the film's successes, it was disappointing to see its failures. That most exceptional of actors, Sir Ian McKellan, is all one could wish for Gandalf (even if he does have to wrap his incredibly plummy vowels around some unfortunate lines, most notably \"You have no power here!\" Denethor was flawed but noble, and he died a brave death, not the cowardly one that Jackson inserted in order to bludgeon the viewer over the head with an opinion about the character. Jackson's treatment of this is evidence of a tendency to be heavy-handed, and not let well enough alone, a trait he shares with Steven Spielberg, another gifted but flawed director who tends to over-sentimentalize, destroying narrative balance in the process.Another disappointment to this reviewer was Howard Shore's pedestrian score. This is as good as any film version was ever going to get. This is the First Law of Narrative: if you fail to make that created world \"real\" to the audience, no amount of intellectual pretension, message, or special effects will redeem the work, whether written or pictorial.The production values are exceptional. The ratio of character development and magical charm diminished over each film in proportion to concentration on Action and Big Battle Effects. Hugo Weaving is impressively regal as Elrond, and Christopher Lee equally so as the powerful but flawed Saruman. There have been film scores that rise to the level of memorable, and it was a shame that this one didn't.Having covered the failures, it is still true that what one is left with stands as a unique achievement and a superb rendering of this beloved literary classic, that so many thought virtually unfilmable for so many years. So much for character development. When Jackson proudly announced that the Battle of the Pelennor Fields would be bigger than the Battle of Helm's Deep, my heart sank - I had an idea what was coming, and I was right. It was serviceable but not memorable, and the overuse of leit-motif (every time a character appears, his theme is heard) became maddening after awhile, and diluted such power as the score had. That is the kind of narrative sacrifice that outrages this reviewer. It was a shameful oversight. While I could (and will) pick a few arguments with artistic decisions made by Peter Jackson in bringing Tolkien's famed Sword and Sorcery trilogy, the Lord of the Rings, to the screen, I must admit that his doing it at all gets him four stars. in The Two Towers, which everyone in the audience I saw it with recognized from \"The Wizard of Oz\", and laughed at). Elijah Wood, seizing the greatest opportunity he probably will ever be offered, makes a wonderful Frodo, if a trifle less rough-hewn than the Frodo imagined from the books (I suspect this was deliberate, to draw attention to the slightly finer spiritual stuff of which Frodo is made). Chief among these was the increasing emphasis on special effects as the saga progressed, especially in the big battle scenes, at the expense of character development. Jackson should have spent a bit less time on Oliphaunts and a bit more time on resolution.This reviewer was also outraged at the treatment of Denethor's death. Special mention goes to Sean Bean for his vulnerable yet heroic portrait of the star-crossed Boromir. Cate Blanchett is perfect as Galadriel, although she would have been even more perfect if her silly crimped curls and Kirk's Folly jewelry didn't make her look more SoHo than Lothlorien. You see her giving a nice smile to Faramir for a split second at Aragorn's coronation and THAT'S ALL FOLKS!!!! If Jackson had knocked five minutes off the interminable Pelennor Fields segment, MAYBE he wouldn't have had to skip completely over the resolution of Eowyn's issues vis-a-vis her love for Aragorn. Serkis gives us Gollum's sorrow, conflicts, glimpses of his former uncorrupted self - in short, gives us all his tormented soul, without ever appearing on screen except for a few minutes of retrospective history early in Film #3. The role will probably also define Wood's career, unfortunate for so young an actor. . . . In fact, there was something hurried about the entire coronation denouement. Liv Tyler makes a beautiful Arwen, and her physical stature (she is about six feet tall) somewhat offsets the fact that she looks much, much younger than Aragorn. Jackson's last-minute substitution of Viggo Mortensen for Stuart Townsend in the role of Aragorn was a great judgment call. And, one could find no fault with Orlando Bloom's Legolas and John Rhys-Davies's Gimli. The care taken to ensure that what Pooh-Bah in \"The Mikado\" referred to as \"artistic verisimilitude\", down to the last details of clothing, armor, flora and fauna, language, etc., in itself represents a fantastic achievement.The cast is likewise exceptional and gives their best. When I saw \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" in New York City the day it was released, a transfixed audience broke into cheers at the end of this segment.If you're not into Sword and Sorcery, and you prefer character development, irony, sophistication, sex, and modernity to the best that this genre can ever offer - you won't \"get\" LOTR.Everyone else will. Leaving in Eowyn's feelings for Aragorn from The Two Towers onward, and leaving out the resolution of those feelings, is inexcusable. I didn't mind Jackson leaving out the journey through the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil - but what you DO include you MUST fulfill. And, while some segments were disappointing to those steeped in LOTR lore from the original material, others were superlative: the journey through the Mines of Moria, and the confrontation on the Bridge between Gandalf and the Balrog, were perfection - one of the finest segments of S&amp;S; ever brought to the screen. .Mortensen brings his particular brand of naturalism to the heavily burdened Ranger/King, and turns what might have been a cardboard hero into a human, doubting man. He marshalled a fantastic cast, for the most part treated the story line laid down by Tolkien respectfully, and served up all the effects, magical and otherwise, color, and realism (if one may use the term at all in connection with Sword &amp; Sorcery) available.Jackson's achivement parallels Tolkien's: a \"created world\" that one steps into and accepts completely from the beginning, and that functions on its own terms, at all levels. Serkis's voice and body work, on which Gollum's reality is fleshed out, is a unique accomplishment. I could not argue with a single piece of casting in the entire three films.But more than all the rest, one must pay homage (as the Academy Awards should have) to Andy Serkis's phenomenal work in bringing to three-dimensional life that by now most legendary of computer generated creatures, Gollum. The long-suffering Sam, and the two younger hobbits, Merry and Pippin, are also well-drawn, no small feat when playing made-up creatures in an S&amp;S; saga.</td>\n",

The continuity obsessives will no doubt have a field day complaining about every little detail that the producer missed, but this is only a movie and the suspension of at least SOME disbelief should be accorded. I was very apprehensive about seeing this movie, believing that Ashton Kutcher in a beard has to mean that he is trying too hard to market himself as something that he's not. \"Donnie Darko\" comparisons are inevitable...the afflicted yet brilliant young man, the malicious company he keeps, the \"stitch in time\" plot in general...anyone who was a fan of one movie should definitely appreciate the other. This has the effect of changing any number of other things that happens consequently, and as a result the present that he realizes changes each time he \"wakes up\". People probably thought the same way when Mel Gibson played \"Hamlet\" in the '80's.But Mel Gibson was great in \"Hamlet\", and Kutcher is actually pretty good in \"The Butterfly Effect\", as well. I don't think I'm totally sold on Ashton making his living in dramatic roles, but he was a lot better than I was initially willing to give him credit for, and it does show that he's a lot more versatile than the other teeny flicks he's made outside of \"That '70's Show\".</td>\n",

       "      <td>The film does not knowingly, cynically make fun of itself or its style, it bravely tells its story in a straightforward manner, which makes it hilarious, as it is not a story that anyone can take seriously. A lot of laughs!When I came upon this little film (and it is little- your eye must adjust to the results of a low budget, but eventually that aesthetic only adds to its charm) I was delighted by its humor and innocence. )But its only real handicap is its budget, which at times masks the quality of the screenwriting and performances. Its unstudied style is refreshing.The film does suffer from a few juvenile misfirings (no pun intended. Further, having stumbled on something new, the filmmakers do not attempt \"hipness,\" which results in a farce free of camp. Whichever, his affect is disarming and adorable, and serves the film well.Mostly, I enjoyed its originality. All in all, viewing this film is time well-spent. Jonathon Green is oddly compelling in his cluelessness; one wonders at times if that was intentional or a lucky accident. I am the sort who is allergic to cliches, even the whiff of one sets me off on a diatribe. Particularly winning are the sparkly Jordan Hoffman as Archangel Ira and Dara Schindler as a reporter on Jesus' trail. What a delight to find a movie that is genuinely quirky and tells a story that hasn't been told. I highly recommend! Essentially it is a film about a nice Jewish boy in spandex who is trying to make the world better, and about the various (and oddly random) archenemies who attempt to thwart him.</td>\n",

They could've just kept the 3 new songs and left off the remixes.I love the performances on the DVD, but I wish that she would've changed the outfits a little bit more often. I loved this DVD-CD combo. She changed into a kind of '50s type outfit that was very classy &amp; it had historical meaning. The remixes on the CD were TERRIBLE! She wore this spectacular white dress with feathers. Give about 3 more numbers with that outfit, then she changed into a yellow dress that she wore for about 5 more songs.</td>\n",

This is one of the old Firm tapes made from clips of older Firm workouts.

       "4       So this time JW make sure it's all top notch quality. I certainly hope he can get the Mid Nite Special &amp; other tv show film of him, as i'd personally like tosee it all, especially any Johnny Winter And footage. Yep, the other reviewers were right when speaking of the qualityof many of the performances on here. STEVEN MUNARI Since on Johnny's website(just use his name to get there)they are asking for anyone withfilm footage or more recent video footage to send it in, I guessJW will do another dvd? The quality is poor, but i'll take any footage of JW possible.

       "5       Following the failure of just about everything, from poor intelligence to lack of communication this movie shows exactly how rough it was to serve in the military during the 1980's. The gun fights are nothing to winch at but, lack the extreme effects and graphic (to date) to make you feel you are there. If only it could have a bigger budget to expand on some areas and added little touches. The movie follows the book very closely, which makes for a very great entertainment. An Grade A example of why the military spends so much money on equipment today. This movie is a must for any fan that is looking for a Sean Bean collection. Which makes it a must for any historian or military \"buff\". Very well written both in book and movie. The locations are very well scouted and whole military attitude is very accurate. Sean Bean is great as both the lead and main character. A must watch for the escape and evasion of Britain's finest military professionals alone. The actors display a grace under fire type of attitude even during capture that is for the military personnel to exemplify. Gripping, exciting filled with real life type of situation.

       "6       The screenwriters give you so many fine red herrings that the ending works quite well. Peter Mullan gives a superb performance as the member of the hazmat team who most engages the audience's sympathies (though his Scots accent is at times a bit impenetrable). This is the standard set-up for a Gothic film (think THE SHINING, the orginal HAUNTING, the first ALIEN), but the unusualness of the hospital, the exceptionally fine performances, and the sophisticated script set this in nearly as high the same class as those aforementioned Gothic classics. The cinematography is exceptionally and beautifully creepy. The actual abandoned Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts is a fantastic Gothic revival pile of a building; it is mostrously oversized, larger than you'd think any such building would have a right to be, and makes an absolutely wonderful setting for this very sophisticated Gothic chiller. Four workers on a hazmat team have one week to remove the asbestos and other hazardous waste products from the abandoned state hospital, with its miles of ugly rotting corridors and empty rooms; by the end of the film there are fewer of the team than when we started.

       "7       If you like this kind of movie, you'll love this one. They just dont make'em like this anymore folks, and it's a shame!The Big Bird Cage has all the R-rated stereo-types that come with a Roger Corman produced WiP film. I'm not going to give away any of the plot, watch it for yourself!Beware that this particular version will not play in a standard U.S. DVD player. But if you happen to have a machine that will play it, this is the edition to get. While fullscreen they clearly surpass the American releases of these films I've seen around, some of which dont even have chapter menus and most of which have atrocious cover art. While it is unfortunately presented full screen (hence 4 stars vesrsus 5), the print and sound are good. If you have a multi-region player, buy with confidence. It seems that many of these old Corman films such as The Big Bird Cage, The Big Dollhouse, Women in Cages and The Arena are not availabe in widescreen, so until that day when they are, I say that these Australian releases from Umbrella Entertainment are the way to go. Some people find much to fault with these old Women in Prison flicks or Exploitation movies in general, and I'll grant that they are not always cinematically great, but in the case of Jack Hill, I think all his movies deserve to be watched if for no other reason than that they are extremely fun. The main character who isnt Pam Grier or Sid Haig is a one time Barker Beauty. Once again the great Jack Hill puts Pam Grier and Sid Haig in major roles and comes out with a winner. With this release the cover and menus are attractive and the extra features many and entertaining.

       "9       I for my part saw the mini series on TNT before reading the book but that's what it took for me to finally make up my mind about reading the 800 plus page book and by the Goddess was it worth it! True, the mini series left out a great deal of info from the book but that is always to be expected when there is a movie adaptation of a book. Some things were also changed from the book to the movie but all in all I thought that the mini series did a fair job and I'm sure that Ms. Zimmer Bradley would have been satisfied with the finished work.The fifth star is for the things that were left out and or changed.

       "11      If you were a part of that time and miss it, as I do, you will very much enjoy this movie. Then again, this movie could be considered a \"niche\" movie, as many younger people who are part of the current hip-hop generation would have a tough time appreciating it. Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston (both of whom are very good actors, and somewhat underrated) turn in good performances.The soundtrack is, in a word, phenomenal. It also is obviously targeting the 80s metal crowd as its audience. For their efforts alone, this movie gets points.One could say that \"Rock Star\" was overlooked at the box office. \"Rock Star\" is a movie that recreates the hard rock era that was the 1980s. There are several original songs recorded by the members of the fictional Steel Dragon band represented in the film. In fact, many of the musicians who recorded the original songs portray their fictional counterparts in the movie. Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne's band, Black Label Society), Jason Bonham (who pounded the skins for his own band, Bonham, as well as being the son of legendary Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham), Jeff Pilson (Dokken), among others, were recruited to bring this band's music to life. Bands of all types of metal (from pop to death) benefited from the popularity that metal experienced during that time, and this movie helps recreate that time for people (like myself) who were young then, and are thankful that they grew up during those years.By now, almost everyone knows that this movie is loosely based on Tim \"Ripper\" Owens of Judas Priest fame, but it doesn't draw heavily from his real-life story.

       "12      It could have succeeded as a major western release without the musical vignettes.I do love this film and will seek a way to edit it myself for my own use. I have been so very impressed and touched by this film. This film has geat quality, excellent casting, and an important message.

       "15      If you thought the anime was funny, you should know it was made more \"TV Friendly\" than the manga. There are instances in which you must throw the book on the floor and laugh your... off for a few minutes before you pick it back up.The DVD's are great, but the special features were bland. I did enjoy the spot-on voice acting and the actors (Onizuka is played by the same guy who plays Spike on Cowboy Bebop, and Tom, the robot host of Toonami). The books are easy to find and are much cheaper, and the comedy is MUCH funnier. A great buy!

       "16      After watching great photography, scary moments and good acting for the most part, I bought the VHS and watched it again. You might like it. It is far better than most of the reviewers said it was. It certainly is far better than most mysteries produced in Hollywood. The sound quality of the VHS was not the best so I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. This was a really enjoyable mystery movie with great music from Globin. Don't always go by what some reviewers say; give it your own personal try. I am glad I rented the VHS when I happened upon it. Max von Sydow was great, as always, and added another dimension to the mystery.

       "18      It has one of those \"good comedy plots,\" because it has a busy, Mel Brooks style plot, but it has lots of comic twists that are halarious. This one is technically an average movie, but is very entertaining. I know the ad looks awful, and stupid, and you think this ranks down with Freddy Got fingered, the new guy, and other comedy movies that make you want your money back just for seeing the trailer. I wish the dvd had deleted scenes, because that would be anice addition to this short film. I wouldn't buy it, but I generally don't buy movies. This film critics hated, but amazon liked. It has so many intervened comedic plots. But the studio was probably smart, since everyone I knew had heard of it, and wanted to see it. It's not. Since this flopped in theaters, they shouyld have advertised this better for the video and dvd release, because it could have been exceedingly popular on home video. Worth renting! For what it is, it's awesome. These are kids that like Freddy Got Fingered, and they thought this was bad. This is an underapprieciated gem that was poorly advertised.

       "19      I got to see The Smokers at the New York Independent Film Festival last year and let me tell you, that film kept me thinking for weeks afterwards. But I have since passed the film around to all my girlfriends and we all unianimously agree that the filmmakers are definitely making a clear statement. The first time I saw it was with my boyfriend, and he just could not relate to the film (perhaps the disturbing subject matter was a little too much for him). I was finally able to get a copy... since the US version was not out yet. It is truly a \"chic flick\". !Definitely a Cult Classic with a message that must be seen to understand.

       "22      I had the VHS tape of this movie as a kid and my daughter watched it so many times it broke. It was a great investment. She wanted another copy so bad and I had a hard time finding it. I was so glad to find a used copy  in such good condition.

       "24      This was a ctually a pretty good tag match, just a little bit too short. Good ending, but a little too predictable. It would be a good addition to your DVD collection.Overall Rating:  8.5/10 You never hear much about this match. (9/10)Overall the PPV was pretty good. It has a great championship match and Rumble match. Again, okay match, but nothing too special. Edge vs. William Regal (Intercontinental)These two had a good fued, but the matches were just never that good. Royal Rumble 2002 was a very good PPV with some action packed undercard matches and one of the most star studded Rumble matches in years.1. There are many close falls and a great announce table to announce table bump. Trish Stratus vs. Jazz (Women's Championship w/Jacqueline as Special Guest Referee)Not a bad woman's match, but who really cares. It is about what you would expect from these two. Surprise appearance by Christian adn Lance Storm. The Rock vs. Chris Jericho (Undisputed Title)This has to be one of the most underrated matches of the year. Tazz & Spike Dudley vs. Dudley boys (WWF Tag Team Championship)Good way to kick off the show. Of course they both bleed pretty good. Royal Rumble Match (Wineer Gets A Shot at Undisputed Title at Wrestlemania 18)This Rumble match featured one of the best fields in years. (6/10)3. (8/10)5. (8/10)2. (7/10)4. Ggreat match. (9/10)6. There is a funny spot were Vince makes Flair's daughter take a picture of Vince and Ric with her camera. Vince McMahon vs. Ric Flair (Street Fight)Good performance put on by these two old timers. It is action packed from beginning to end. Some of the highlights include Maven eliminating The Undertaker and Taker proceeding to destroy Maven all over the arena, the Triple H and Austin stare down, the return of Goldust, Val Venis, The Godfather, Mr.

       "25      It is not one of the best Wrestlemania's, but it is great for this match alone.Overall Rating:  8.5/10 The Rock vs. Hollywood Hulk HoganQuite simply put, one of the best matches you will ever see. It is one of the best and highest you will ever see. It features one of the best matches you will ever see and the last time the WWF had a PPV were RAW and Smackdown did not have separate rosters.1. A lot of people did not enjoy this match, but I thought it was great. It was a great Wrestlemania, not one of the better ones, but still the best. It could have been better, but too much focus was on Triple H and Stepahie. The crowd was kind of out of it, but it was a good match. Most notably is the Hogan/Warrior match from Wrestlemania VI in its entirety.Buy this DVD just for the Hogan/Rock match. But, I thought it was probably the third or fourth best PPV of the year. Triple H vs. Chris Jericho (Undisputed Title)Good match, not one of the better Wrestlemania main events, but still good nonetheless. The crowd makes this match even more entertaining. Rob Van Dam (Intercontinental Title)Pretty good way to start off the show. Jazz vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus (Women's Title/Triple Threat)I am not a fan of women's matches, but this one was pretty decent. The match has a good pace to it and a strong finish with a lot of close falls. These two mixed well together or maybe it is just Angle making everybody look good. It was kind of a stupid set up. It was a great match. Great action, and strong finish. Ric Flair vs. Undertaker (No DQ)Great match. Match of the year in my opinion. Good match featuring a mixture of styles. Great finish that features a run in by Arn Anderson. Kurt Angle vs. KaneVery good, underrated match. Great match. Words can't even describe how great this match is. D-Von takes a good bump off the turnbuckle and through a table. Edge vs. Booker TThis match stemmed from the stupid angle involving the hair shampoo commercial. Hardy Boys vs. Dudley's vs. Billy & Chuck vs. APA (Tag Title/Fatal Fourway Elimination)Another very good match. This match would actually keep going on throughout the night featuring a number of wrestlers: Crash Holly, Spike Dudley, Mighty Molly, The Hurricane, and Christian. One of the top ten matches of the year in my opinion. Watch for the top rope superplex by Taker on Flair. (7.5/10)2. (10/10)10. (7.5/10)7. (7/10)3. Goldust vs. Maven (Hardcore Title)Typical hardcore match. (8/10)9. (8.5/10)8. Okay match. Wow!!!!!!!! Unbelievable finish. (7.5/10)4. (9/10)6. William Regal vs. (8.5/10)5. Diamond Dallas Page vs. Christian (European Title)This match resulted from DDP trying to help Christian stop throwing temper tantrums and Christian in turn, turning his back on DDP. Pretty good match, although Booker T has lost a step from his WCW days. Good finish between the final two teams. Kevin Nash gets involved heavily in the match. Good backdrop from one announce table to the next by Jerico on Triple H.  Good ending. (8/10)This is actually a 2 disc set, with a lot of extra features. The crowd was really on RVD's side. There is a lot of blood in the match. Unfortunately, this PPV was criticized by many people. (7/10)11. He slides halfway across the ring. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Scott HallAnother match that was overlooked. Watch the ref slide into the ring when one of the refs is out. The crowd goes crazy. What the heck was the WWF thinking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "26      A beautiful transfer of the film that is the complete 150 minute version. Still, a magnificent movie. I still wonder if some of the battle scenes were toned down to obtain a PG rating. A final act of revenge near the conclusion also appears to have been edited to remove more graphic bullet wounds.

       "27      The movie was great and the plot was excellent but the ending (...) blew. Other than that the movie was spectacular. The company will make a lot of mone off this movie becasue they have to have a sequal so everyone who saw it the first time will crawl back to the theatre wanting to know what happen next. There was no ending. Come on.

       "28      I hated this movie the first time my roommate made me watch it, but after the sixth or seventh, Stockholm syndrome set in and I started to... well, not like, but appreciate how gloriously bad this movie is. This has to be one of the worst films ever made, but if you sit down to watch it knowing that and ready to laugh, it's worth your time.Imagine Highlander made by a freshman film student, with some of his friends and/or random people off the street reading lines they have never read before, with a budget that consists solely of change found in said freshman's furniture, and you'll have scratched the surface of how amateurish, campy, and unintentionally hilarious this movie is.Lorenzo Lamas's hair alone demands viewing, as does the opening scene, wherein a guy (ostensibly a \"demon\") is standing on a wall, straight out from a wall... and there, as clear as the agony on your face, is the wire holding him up. It makes Leonard Part Six look like Citizen Kane, Gigli look like Seven Samurai, Showgirls look like Casablanca, and Episode II look like Episode V.  It's that bad, and revels in it.God bless you, Lorenzo Lamas. I offer my highest recommendations, if only for the cringing laughs and laughing cringes this steaming pile is bound to elicit, from the aforementioned opening to the ending credits.You owe it to every decent film in existence to see this, so you can appreciate how much better every other movie ever made is. Never give up, and never change your hair.

       "57164   The acting was very good in this movie, esspecially Tim Robbins character. Although the story did seem to jump from one thing to another, everything else about the movie seemed fine. I hope that this DVD comes out soon so that I can watch again and maybe I'll understand the story a little bit better. This is one flick that I am happy I saw.

       "57165   Herlin Riley gives a great performance and instruction in the old style of playing, and leads up to the newer styles. The companion book to this DVD is very good and highly recommended as well. Highly recommended..Nicholas Payton is on trumpet but seems to be having a bad day, as does the piano player who hits clams on \"High Society\". However the focus is on the drumming and thats what counts.Johnny Vidacovich gives a fine performance and instruction as well.I have not gotten to the last two drummers ( Earl Palmer and Herman Ernest)  but would recommend the DVD on just the first two gents alone.If you want to learn New Orleans style drumming, this is the best DVD I have seen so far.

       "57167   Unfortunately, the episodes which were NOT written by these people were rather hot and cold.My main problem with the series is the acting now, but honestly as a child I never even noticed how exaggerated it was. I grew up watching both this version of Land of the Lost, thanks to my dad, as well as the 1990s remake. I honestly think that the original was a lot better, especially considering how much earlier it was made (the 1970s). This version features some great scripts by respected science-fiction authors such as Larry Niven, David Gerrold, DC Fontana, and Ben Bova. They enter a closed universe, which is just a term that means you can move in any direction and you will come right back to your starting point eventually. The episode \"Circle\" is an especially good one, adding much better continuity to the series.Sure, the effects were cheesy. But it was a Saturday morning kid's show during the 1970s. There is even a point at which the family sees themselves while looking at a far-away point with their binoculars. I was much more interested in the overarching plot, and understanding how this strange \"Land of the Lost\" worked. I think we can forgive the claymation dinosaurs. Some often make the mistake of thinking that the Marshall family went back in time in this show - that is not what happens in the series.

       "57171   I have to echo some of the previous posters' comments about this DVD - it *is* good stuff, and great to see concert footage from such a long time ago. Someone else may want to comment on this.And yes, the absence of Kim Deal. I suppose this (and the fact there is not so much 'later career' stuff shown) indicates the paucity of stuff contolled/owned by 4AD. Or maybe I'm wrong? Pity, as her voice would have competed the tale. Any idea why she didn't contribute?

       "57172   It is a tremendous piece of work and deserves far more honor than it received.All that said about the film's successes, it was disappointing to see its failures. That most exceptional of actors, Sir Ian McKellan, is all one could wish for Gandalf (even if he does have to wrap his incredibly plummy vowels around some unfortunate lines, most notably \"You have no power here!\" Denethor was flawed but noble, and he died a brave death, not the cowardly one that Jackson inserted in order to bludgeon the viewer over the head with an opinion about the character. Jackson's treatment of this is evidence of a tendency to be heavy-handed, and not let well enough alone, a trait he shares with Steven Spielberg, another gifted but flawed director who tends to over-sentimentalize, destroying narrative balance in the process.Another disappointment to this reviewer was Howard Shore's pedestrian score. This is as good as any film version was ever going to get. This is the First Law of Narrative: if you fail to make that created world \"real\" to the audience, no amount of intellectual pretension, message, or special effects will redeem the work, whether written or pictorial.The production values are exceptional. The ratio of character development and magical charm diminished over each film in proportion to concentration on Action and Big Battle Effects. Hugo Weaving is impressively regal as Elrond, and Christopher Lee equally so as the powerful but flawed Saruman. There have been film scores that rise to the level of memorable, and it was a shame that this one didn't.Having covered the failures, it is still true that what one is left with stands as a unique achievement and a superb rendering of this beloved literary classic, that so many thought virtually unfilmable for so many years. So much for character development. When Jackson proudly announced that the Battle of the Pelennor Fields would be bigger than the Battle of Helm's Deep, my heart sank - I had an idea what was coming, and I was right. It was serviceable but not memorable, and the overuse of leit-motif (every time a character appears, his theme is heard) became maddening after awhile, and diluted such power as the score had. That is the kind of narrative sacrifice that outrages this reviewer. It was a shameful oversight. While I could (and will) pick a few arguments with artistic decisions made by Peter Jackson in bringing Tolkien's famed Sword and Sorcery trilogy, the Lord of the Rings, to the screen, I must admit that his doing it at all gets him four stars. in The Two Towers, which everyone in the audience I saw it with recognized from \"The Wizard of Oz\", and laughed at). Elijah Wood, seizing the greatest opportunity he probably will ever be offered, makes a wonderful Frodo, if a trifle less rough-hewn than the Frodo imagined from the books (I suspect this was deliberate, to draw attention to the slightly finer spiritual stuff of which Frodo is made). Chief among these was the increasing emphasis on special effects as the saga progressed, especially in the big battle scenes, at the expense of character development. Jackson should have spent a bit less time on Oliphaunts and a bit more time on resolution.This reviewer was also outraged at the treatment of Denethor's death. Special mention goes to Sean Bean for his vulnerable yet heroic portrait of the star-crossed Boromir. Cate Blanchett is perfect as Galadriel, although she would have been even more perfect if her silly crimped curls and Kirk's Folly jewelry didn't make her look more SoHo than Lothlorien. You see her giving a nice smile to Faramir for a split second at Aragorn's coronation and THAT'S ALL FOLKS!!!! If Jackson had knocked five minutes off the interminable Pelennor Fields segment, MAYBE he wouldn't have had to skip completely over the resolution of Eowyn's issues vis-a-vis her love for Aragorn. Serkis gives us Gollum's sorrow, conflicts, glimpses of his former uncorrupted self - in short, gives us all his tormented soul, without ever appearing on screen except for a few minutes of retrospective history early in Film #3. The role will probably also define Wood's career, unfortunate for so young an actor. . . . In fact, there was something hurried about the entire coronation denouement. Liv Tyler makes a beautiful Arwen, and her physical stature (she is about six feet tall) somewhat offsets the fact that she looks much, much younger than Aragorn. Jackson's last-minute substitution of Viggo Mortensen for Stuart Townsend in the role of Aragorn was a great judgment call. And, one could find no fault with Orlando Bloom's Legolas and John Rhys-Davies's Gimli. The care taken to ensure that what Pooh-Bah in \"The Mikado\" referred to as \"artistic verisimilitude\", down to the last details of clothing, armor, flora and fauna, language, etc., in itself represents a fantastic achievement.The cast is likewise exceptional and gives their best. When I saw \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" in New York City the day it was released, a transfixed audience broke into cheers at the end of this segment.If you're not into Sword and Sorcery, and you prefer character development, irony, sophistication, sex, and modernity to the best that this genre can ever offer - you won't \"get\" LOTR.Everyone else will. Leaving in Eowyn's feelings for Aragorn from The Two Towers onward, and leaving out the resolution of those feelings, is inexcusable. I didn't mind Jackson leaving out the journey through the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil - but what you DO include you MUST fulfill. And, while some segments were disappointing to those steeped in LOTR lore from the original material, others were superlative: the journey through the Mines of Moria, and the confrontation on the Bridge between Gandalf and the Balrog, were perfection - one of the finest segments of S&S; ever brought to the screen. .Mortensen brings his particular brand of naturalism to the heavily burdened Ranger/King, and turns what might have been a cardboard hero into a human, doubting man. He marshalled a fantastic cast, for the most part treated the story line laid down by Tolkien respectfully, and served up all the effects, magical and otherwise, color, and realism (if one may use the term at all in connection with Sword & Sorcery) available.Jackson's achivement parallels Tolkien's: a \"created world\" that one steps into and accepts completely from the beginning, and that functions on its own terms, at all levels. Serkis's voice and body work, on which Gollum's reality is fleshed out, is a unique accomplishment. I could not argue with a single piece of casting in the entire three films.But more than all the rest, one must pay homage (as the Academy Awards should have) to Andy Serkis's phenomenal work in bringing to three-dimensional life that by now most legendary of computer generated creatures, Gollum. The long-suffering Sam, and the two younger hobbits, Merry and Pippin, are also well-drawn, no small feat when playing made-up creatures in an S&S; saga.   \n",
       "57173   The Little Rascals: The Complete CollectionI am a Little Rascals/Hal roach fan.Although this is a wonderful addition to any Rascal fans collection it is not complete.There is a short missing when \"Breezy\"Brisbane disrupts the class(with fake car horns etc.) and his penance is to read Sherwood's corny poem(we hear Breezy thinking\"learn that poem\").

       "57174   It's just what I was looking for when I purchased the film, so I'd say that my $20 was well spent. It was mostly for me eye candy though. I liked this movie. I actually had to watch it a couple of times before I actually stopped drooling profusely over Hyde and Gackt (two of the most beautiful men alive, if you'll pardon my fangirling) and paid attention to the fact that there was actually a STORY to work with, too.There is a lot of gunplay in the film, and not as much vampire action as I would have liked, but the story was touching, although at times a little too much was going on at once. Hyde looks delicious (I prefer him dark-haired, though), and Gackt looks extra-tasty, pretty eyes and all.

       "57175   The \"director's cut\" edition is particularly satisfying if you're looking for an ending that is essentially the antithesis of the moral found in the Christmas classic \"It's A Wonderful Life\".It's a good movie. The continuity obsessives will no doubt have a field day complaining about every little detail that the producer missed, but this is only a movie and the suspension of at least SOME disbelief should be accorded. I was very apprehensive about seeing this movie, believing that Ashton Kutcher in a beard has to mean that he is trying too hard to market himself as something that he's not. \"Donnie Darko\" comparisons are inevitable...the afflicted yet brilliant young man, the malicious company he keeps, the \"stitch in time\" plot in general...anyone who was a fan of one movie should definitely appreciate the other. This has the effect of changing any number of other things that happens consequently, and as a result the present that he realizes changes each time he \"wakes up\". People probably thought the same way when Mel Gibson played \"Hamlet\" in the '80's.But Mel Gibson was great in \"Hamlet\", and Kutcher is actually pretty good in \"The Butterfly Effect\", as well. I don't think I'm totally sold on Ashton making his living in dramatic roles, but he was a lot better than I was initially willing to give him credit for, and it does show that he's a lot more versatile than the other teeny flicks he's made outside of \"That '70's Show\".

       "57177   This movie is well worth an hour and a half or so of your time. An interesting little story that is quite humorous while telling the tale of three people of very different circumstances that share much in common. Even though additional footage may have been anti-climatic, I was still just a little sorry to see this film end. Their trials and tribulations are, for the most part, very believable, touching and understandable.

       "57180   The only complaint I have is that on part 1 of &quot;There's No Place Like Home&quot;, they edit out about 10 minutes worth of scenes. Other than that, it's great. I have only noticed this one. I always thought that box sets were uncut. I hope that the company does not do that with other episodes.

       "57181   All three of the feature characters are wonderful. We watched this movie when it came out in a theater and enjoyed it.

       "57185   The only thing I have to complain about is the part on the mountain where I could tell it was filmed indoors--too much echo and &#34;indoor' noise. Otherwise, a scenario that could definitely happen. I am not a climber, so I can't vouch for any techniques or decisions on a mountain.

       "57186   The film does not knowingly, cynically make fun of itself or its style, it bravely tells its story in a straightforward manner, which makes it hilarious, as it is not a story that anyone can take seriously. A lot of laughs!When I came upon this little film (and it is little- your eye must adjust to the results of a low budget, but eventually that aesthetic only adds to its charm) I was delighted by its humor and innocence. )But its only real handicap is its budget, which at times masks the quality of the screenwriting and performances. Its unstudied style is refreshing.The film does suffer from a few juvenile misfirings (no pun intended. Further, having stumbled on something new, the filmmakers do not attempt \"hipness,\" which results in a farce free of camp. Whichever, his affect is disarming and adorable, and serves the film well.Mostly, I enjoyed its originality. All in all, viewing this film is time well-spent. Jonathon Green is oddly compelling in his cluelessness; one wonders at times if that was intentional or a lucky accident. I am the sort who is allergic to cliches, even the whiff of one sets me off on a diatribe. Particularly winning are the sparkly Jordan Hoffman as Archangel Ira and Dara Schindler as a reporter on Jesus' trail. What a delight to find a movie that is genuinely quirky and tells a story that hasn't been told. I highly recommend! Essentially it is a film about a nice Jewish boy in spandex who is trying to make the world better, and about the various (and oddly random) archenemies who attempt to thwart him.

       "57190   It can be a little too silly at times, but that's no big deal; I think the mix of action and comedy is why it was such a big hit. If you're a fan of the show like I am, or just curious to see what the fuss was about, buy this collection and go for a ride with the Duke boys. Otherwise, this is a great collection. There are not many extras, which was disappointing. The show does not seem dated at all.

       "57192   Let me start off by saying that Beyonc&eacute; is my favorite celebrity of ALL TIME! Her voice sounded amazing on the entire DVD, but this performance took the prize.Great Voice, Great Show, Buy the DVD! Then she did \"Dangerously In Love 2\", my favorite performance on the DVD. They could've just kept the 3 new songs and left off the remixes.I love the performances on the DVD, but I wish that she would've changed the outfits a little bit more often. I loved this DVD-CD combo. She changed into a kind of '50s type outfit that was very classy & it had historical meaning. The remixes on the CD were TERRIBLE! She wore this spectacular white dress with feathers. Give about 3 more numbers with that outfit, then she changed into a yellow dress that she wore for about 5 more songs.
