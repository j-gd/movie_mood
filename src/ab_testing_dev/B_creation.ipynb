There is conflict among the household, like when prayers are offered before a meal. Then a knock on the door brings another couple to this house; they are also lost. The guests tell about themselves.

Does the butler have a drinking problem? Will something terrible happen? If a madman is locked up what will happen if he is released?

       "862419  This is the film version of the J.B. Priestly horror novel. It was a dark and stormy night, a couple is driving on a muddy country road through the Welsh mountains. Their touring car does not have side curtains. They are lost, and pull into a house with lights. The Femm household has some strange characters. This house has its own electricity. There is conflict among the household, like when prayers are offered before a meal. Then a knock on the door brings another couple to this house; they are also lost. The guests tell about themselves. [Filming in the rain must have been a technical breakthrough that year.]When they go to fetch a lamp they hear a strange sound. Is there someone in a locked room? Does the butler have a drinking problem? Will something terrible happen? If a madman is locked up what will happen if he is released? Will the innocent survive and the guilty die?This is boring and almost unwatchable film, a waste of time. It does show the performances of some actors who became more famous years later. Some of the scenes reflect the hidden quirks of the actors.   \n",

There is conflict among the household, like when prayers are offered before a meal. The guests tell about themselves. [Filming in the rain must have been a technical breakthrough that year. Is there someone in a locked room? Does the butler have a drinking problem? Will something terrible happen? If a madman is locked up what will happen if he is released? Will the innocent survive and the guilty die?This is boring and almost unwatchable film, a waste of time. It does show the performances of some actors who became more famous years later.
