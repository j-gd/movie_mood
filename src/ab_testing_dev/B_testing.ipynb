      "146  Keira Knightley can bring integrity to any movie, but she especially does so here in this sweet, entertaining flick. She's a shining star on the rise.I'm not usually a big fan of Disney productions but I really liked this, since it was not your typical Disney flick. It was very entertaining and lavishly filmed, set in some absolutely spectacular locations, and starred some really top-notch actors. There were funny moments, sad moments and moments of high action, all nicely interspersed. The only thing I found a tad disappointing was the big fight scene towards the end, since it was a little bit tame and slow, but I accept that because this is a family movie, they couldn't really embrace full-on violence.I was more than satisfied with the slightly non-conventional (for Disney) ending...it ended the way it should, in a somewhat non-predictable way. And I loved the prince, too...he was very charming!Even though this is a family movie, it's intelligently enough written to appeal to mature adults as well, particularly fans of medieval and adventure films.   \n",
      "147  This is a family favorite at my house. We've seen it countless times! Kiera Knightly does an impressive job (at 15, no less). It's free of excessive violence and profanity, making it great for kids! And it has a nice amount of action, making it exciting for the boys. The end has an interesting twist (no I'm not telling!) that isn't exactly expected. Nonetheless, it's a great film that I would recommend to anyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
