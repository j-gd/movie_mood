I also did not give it five stars because it would have been nice to have the \"her ghost in the fog\" video on here, and finally I thin Dani could have done better on some parts of the songs. For example: On \"her ghost in the fog\" (live version), he chooses to growl in that typical death metal voice, instead of talking in the deep gothic voice like he does on the album. By using this growly voice, I think he is cheese'n off some of the songs best parts. Anyway, these are minor gripes and this is a must have DVD, so definitely BUY IT!...</td>\n",

In the style of Napoleon Dynamite describing a Liger, I would say \"...they're pretty much my favorite band.\"  Their music is among the worst in the industry, they suck in a way few bands can meaningfully aspire to.  I've seen them live, bought pretty much every t-shirt from every album and tour, and have almost every album that they've released over the last \"decade and a bit\".  I love it, I love it all.  I recently purchased Heavy, Left-Handed, &amp; Candid.  If you don't like Cradle of Filth, then you'll most certainly hate this DVD.  It's absolutely fantastic, full of everything I was hoping for.There is a bunch of documentary type stuff, eleven live performances, a couple of music videos, and a few other \"shorts\" put together by the band.  Another one of the bonus items they threw on the disc is a short movie called \"The Blair Twit Project\".  This is basically footage of the band walking through woodland, filmed entirely using the night-vision mode on a video camera as they follow the trail of \"a pissed northern bastard.\"  Being a \"northerner\" myself, it felt very much like a standard night walking home from the pub on a Friday night being idiots.  It's funny to watch *once*.The DVD is actually really well put together and there is a ton of material included, which is a refreshing change when compared to some other music DVDs I've bought that barely even take the time to put a decent menu together.  As with their music, most people will hate this DVD.  I loved it, but then again, I'm weird.  The live performances are pretty awesome and it has solidified my decision to have to see this band again soon.  I don't know if they come to the US very often if at all, but some guy in Hot Topic assured me that he'd seen them here a few years ago.  I'll have to keep my eyes on the tour dates.  Then the hardest job will be convincing anyone to actually go with me.  My wife say's she's up for it, but I think that will have to be seen to be believed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Wow, I thought I rambled, but Lau Ching wan takes it to another level!  His character is so complex, and there's so many things that I pick up on in his performance when I rewatch this movie.  I didn't really know how to fit these thoughts into my review, so I thought I would just point it out right away.  That quote above is classic rambling from Lau Ching Wan's character.  I don't know how I didn't get annoyed of his character, but Lau Ching Wan just gives such a great performance.  I kept wanting to hear what he had to say, because the more he rambles on, the more violent he gets with his words.  Great stuff.Lau Ching Wan stars as a gangster who just got out of jail, and right away he gets into a fight.  After his brawl he decides to stay at a really cheap inn run by a poor widow played by Ruby Wong.  They slowly begin a relationship, and I found it well done and touching.  Lau Ching Wan's character is over the top with how rude he is, but he does a great job at it.  I really found myself liking his character, even though his character is supposed to be almost completely unlikeable.  One scene I liked was when Lau Ching Wan literally forces the owner of the inn and her son to go out and have a day of fun with him.  It is quite an odd scene.  So they go out for the day, and do all types of fun things.  For instance Lau Ching Wan shows them what part of a wall he painted while he was in prison. But seriously, there are a lot of good things about this movie.  There's one hilarious scene where Lau throws a big fit screaming at the inn owner that his room has been taken.  He couldn't have been a bigger baby.  She doesn't say a word, politely shows him to his room, and when the door opens, the drunken Lau Ching Wan figures out after a few seconds that he must have been in the wrong room before.  Such a great scene.  There's some more scenes like that, and that's the main reason the movie is worth watching.  Plus you have those great small touches that Johnnie To is known for.  Like when the inn owner is cleaning Lau's room, she sees a big pile of money in his drawer, and she shuts the drawer right away.  Good scene with good character development for both actors.  But then what Johnnie To does is expand on it.  About 4 days pass, and she is cleaning his room, and once again sees his drawer open, but this time that big pile of money is nothing but a few bills.  Like I said, it's just a small touch.While this movie isn't that exciting, and it's anything but original, I loved the directing job, the acting, dialogue,  the short action scenes, and I found myself laughing outloud at least a few times.  Lau Ching Wan + Johnnie To.  How can you go wrong with that?  You can't.  And you also have Lam Suet giving a great performance.  This is back when he actually got good roles.  Nowadays it seems like he just gets really small roles or cameos in Johnnie To movies.  Don't expect a great thriller or something really exciting, just an enjoyable movie.Rating- 4/5The subtitles on the Universe DVD are well written, but they go by a bit too fast most of the time.  Sound is good.  5.1 and 3.0 Cantonese and Mandarin tracks.  And the picture quality isn't exactly HD, but still very good.</td>\n",

She's more of a solid, consistent performer than a blow-you-away performer, but that's hardly a bad thing.  She comes alive onstage and brings a warmth and joy to her performances that her best records can only hint at.  (Not that she doesn't make consistently records--she does.)This 1995 performance tape (and you have to keep in mind that it was originally VHS) captures her and her band at their best.  Yes, the sound could be better, but even in an actual performance setting, you might find yourself complaining about the acoustics a bit.  If the performance is solid, you can begin to overlook a few sound problems. So too with this DVD.Guests like Jackson Browne, Ruth Brown and Charles Brown and even some non-Brown(e)s like Kim Wilson and Bryan Adams add to the special event quality of the performance. And Bruce Hornsby adds his distinctive piano to a couple of numbers.  (\"I Can't Make You Love Me\" is particularly affecting.) But my favorite numbers are those featuring  Bonnie and her great band.  The chemistry between them is palpable.She ain't no amoeba.</td>\n",

A lot of the time the music and film are out of sync, but what is worse is that more than once shots belonging to an other part of the concert are used to fill up gaps elsewhere. I cannot believe that the editor actually thinks that the viewer is stupid enough to fall for these cheap solutions. The mistakes are often so obvious! It is not enough to show, let's say, a drummer who is drumming. NO! We want to see that that drummer is actually playing that particular part of the music that is coming from our speakers at that particular moment.Still, as I said, the concert is great, and the DVD is worth 4 stars; a must have for all her fans.</td>\n",

What a musical performance!  And this woman who commented on the bare-chested guys in the audience (what audacity!).  I have to be honest--haven't followed every recording of her career.  But everytime I hear her I'm floored.  Here's a woman who can belt out a ballad, play the blues, and put the most loving touch on a folk song, to bring you to tears.  Versatility is Raitt.  You want proof!?  Just see her on the Stevie Ray Vaughan tribute belting out &amp;quot;Pride and Joy.&amp;quot;  She takes a guy song and makes it into the quintessential girl's torch song!  All I can say is she made a lot of guys lonely (including me!) when she mentions a husband in the concert.  But hey, we are happy for you Bonnie.But what a minute!  The production on this video just doesn't do Bonnie justice.  I've heard much about the audio problems, and I agree.  But the video doesn't give us fans a chance!  I want something more than 5 seconds of a sustained shot on Bonnie and her guitar.  The music is there, but a bit more of Bonnie, without endless cuts to her band, would be desirable.  (A great band mind you, but nonetheless it couldn't hurt to let us see her a bit more!)I would love to see Bonnie in a proper DVD.  How about it Bonnie!  There're plenty of us out here that would love to hear from you.  You are a legend now, like BB and Buddy.  Put your music on record (in resplendent DVD)!  I'll be waiting.</td>\n",

We just get snippets of great songs and rare concert footage, and there isn't any interviews or commentary with the rest of the band (save for Linda's posthumous comments) especially from loyal, talented, long-suffering Denny Laine who was there from start to finish.

I suspect McCartney and his daughter intended to make a documentary about Wings but ended up with one about Paul and Linda instead.  But that's okay, although they should have changed the name of the DVD.The best feature of Wingspan is that Paul, for once, is remarkably articulate in the interview sections.  The questions are more intimate than you might expect from his own daughter, too.  It can't have been easy for him to talk with her about such issues as the drug bust in Japan - but he does it, apparently quite honestly.  I also loved the early films and stories of the retreat in Scotland immediately before and after the Beatles broke up, and the first Wings tour.  The shots of the 1976 American tour are also terrific - if there's enough footage of those shows for a full-length DVD, everyone who sees this will want to buy it.  Just sayin', guys.  While most fans will already know some of the stories he tells, there are several here that I've never heard before, notably the origin of \"Mrs. Vanderbilt\" and the reggae bridge in \"Live and Let Die.\"  I also came away with a lot more respect for Linda after watching this, even if the fact remains that she couldn't sing.What's not so good is the discussion of the other members of Wings and the band's work as a whole - which, after all, is apparently what the show was supposed to be about in the first place.  With occasional exceptions, the talk about the songs is fairly cursory, and this is even more true when it comes to the musicians.  Denny Laine, the only constant member of Wings besides Paul and Linda (and, on two occasions, the only other member of the band) doesn't get anywhere near the screen time he warrants.  Some of the other members literally only get one mention in passing.  Then again, that is an accurate reflection of how long they were in the group!  Their best-selling album, \"Wings at the Speed of Sound,\" isn't discussed at all and only about a minute's worth of it is even used as background music.  (I can't help wondering if this is Paul and Mary's way of acknowledging that, big as it was, it's not a very good album.)  During the segment on the 1976 tour, he recites a rather obnoxious nursery rhyme he made up in response to questions about a Beatles reunion - without ever mentioning that Ringo turned up at one of the shows and he seemed quite happy about it at the time.  I'd love to know why he left that out.Overall, the good outweighs the bad.  Now, let's see about a full-length Wings concert DVD...</td>\n",

       "      <td>For this \"rockumentary,\" Paul McCartney is interviewed by his daughter. He is very playful and relaxed, given his familiarity with the interviewer. At the beginning of the program we witness the dissolution of the Beatles and the marriage of Paul and Linda. Interestingly, none of the other Beatles were in attendance at the hastily arranged nuptials. Later, Paul wonders if he can make it as a solo artist. After releasing a couple of solo albums, he decides to form a new band. His wife Linda would be a member of the group, even though she had little musical experience. Paul admired Denny Laine's guitar playing and singing with the Moody Blues.  Denny was asked to join his new group Wings. As it turned out, Denny Laine was the ONLY member of Wings to stay with the group from start to finish, other than Linda. However, his musical contributions - what songs he wrote and sang on, or contributed a guitar solo to - are never discussed. Mr. Laine was not interviewed for this DVD, nor are any clips of old interviews with him included. Other band members are only mentioned in passing although, to be fair, most only lasted with Wings a short time.As Paul said near the end of the program, he proved that he could have major hits and successful world tours with another band after the Beatles. After Paul's infamous drug bust in Japan, he felt that it was time to give everything a rest. Thus Wings ended, not with a bang but with a whimper. Surprisingly, there is no booklet or even an insert included with the DVD. The extras include complete live performances of two songs - \"Jet\" and \"Let 'Em In\" - as well as the studio session for the instrumental \"Rockestra.\" The discography contains mistakes; when you click on the song list for \"Wings Over America\" it displays the song list for \"Wings At The Speed Of Sound.\" A little more attention to detail and interviews with other band members could easily have made this a 5 star DVD.</td>\n",

I think folks are judging it to harshly based on the quality of the DVD. I admit, in the beginning the aspect ratio is squeezed together to fit TVs and the picture looks elongated, this is annoying. Then this technique is switched to just chopping of the sides of the wide screen original.

Most of my friends think Big O [stinks], but I love it, despite some of the obvious drawbacks.First of all, the drawing style [is bad], I admit that. Looks slightly American, and some of the characters are cartoonish, not the realistic portrayal shown by other anime. However, I like how the background and tone is set, expressing the emotionlessness of Paradigm City.The plot rules. Earlier someone mentioned the movie \"Dark City\" in their review, and I think that Dark City and Big O have many things alike. The plot is dark, mysterious, a psychological thriller.I'd recommend this for average anime fans. Most extreme anime otakus don't like this kind of simple style and plot.</td>\n",

       "      <td>First off; that never-produced second season of Big O is finally just around the corner!  The pay-off to season one's pent up pressure will finally be released!  Two years after its American network airing, 'tis 'bout bloody time!I've been catching this series again on Adult Swim as of late, with some of its (mercifully) restored edits.  An aside: This was the anime that *got* me hooked on anime.  A two-year binge thenceforth followed in which I exposed myself to dozens of other series/OAVs/Movies.  Some ja ne sais quoi about Big O in particular just engrossed me.  Mayhaps it'll do the same for you, or already has!The homages to Batman are very overt and at times quite literal: The dapper Bruce Wayne-esque Roger Smith, diplomatic plutocrat by day, maverick vigilantte by night.  Norman, the butler, is the benevolent shadow that assists Roger behind the scenes whilst saving enough time to prepare dinner and turn down the sheets.  Then there's Roger and his grudging relationship of mutual respect with \"legitimate\" law enforcement.  And of course, we have the cartel of deranged villians that Roger has to put up with, each with their own maniacal plan concerning Paradigm City.Big O has its own sylistic flourishes.  Big O ditches the superhero spandex and costumes; Roger Smith is still in his double-breasted suit when he climbs into his megadeuce to save the day; that blond loony Beck is the Joker without the face-paint.  Paradigm City is a semi-inhabited dilapiated metropolis, a crumbling gothic expanse filled with stories of forgotten pasts, people, and events, waiting to be exumed, which in itself is more mysterious and ominous than Gotham City.  And instead of a sidekick, Roger Smith has his charge Dorothy, a well-mannered android debuntante with a red bob in a sensible/elegant black dress who deadpans all her lines.  Yet, she occassionally emotes in an understated fashion that's particularly satisfying in that way that AI creations become, if only for a moment, \"human.\"  Dorothy's scenes of romantic tension betwixt she and Roger are also precious.As for the bad bits of this anime, well, it *is* a mecha-anime after all, which means, sooner or later in the episode, big robots are going to stomp around blowing stuff up.  Occassionally it gets overblown, overlong, and silly.  It's a necessary evil.  Thankfully it's underplayed compared to Big O's mecha breatheren, and the allure of Paradigm City is never compromised.  On the otherhand character development is rather slipshod; new dimensions of Roger Smith don't really crop up (one gets the impression he prefers it this way, considering his views on Paradigm City), and much of the supporting cast are mere caricatures (take the noir-cliche of Angel, the femme fatal with the dangerous past and double-edged motives).  Dorothy is the sole expection here, and the most interesting character.Nutshell: Big O is surprisingly watchable, sometimes mature, sub-noir anime (even if it occassionally apes the vibe of Cowboy Bebop).  A definite gem in the anime mine.  If not a diamond, than definitely, say, an amythest.</td>\n",

In the series of 4 discs this is the one to see above all others, the last episode sums up a good 75% of everthing thats been happening. IT clears up alot of questions and gives some quick backround into a lot of characters. However the series ends on a monster of a cliffhanger for sure. And thats it. no 2nd season was ever produced, it may someday, but at the moment does not exist. So when it ends, you go..&amp;quot;wow that was cool!But  what the hell's going on?&amp;quot; So you kinda have to use your imagination to end the series. But if you've bought some of the other discs and liked them definately buy this one. The disc is standard fare, the extras, picture and audio are all the same as before. But these are the 3 episodes you should see, they really shed alot of light on the story, as well as create a bunch more questions. The 3 epsiodes are-a threat is brought upon the city promising destruction. it's the xmas episode.-Schzartwald gets himself a mega dues. Not one of those cheezy homeade bots either. this is like another Big O.-Roger smith learns about the past of paradigm, and the same thing that happened 40 years ago happens again.Buy it, love it. get upset at the ending. and write sunrise entertainment and tell them to make more episodes.</td>\n",

This DVD concludes the series with some of the most climactic battles and even a few romantic scenes too.  Though the series was brief, nontheless, it was a classic in my opinion.  Pretty much, take Batman's character, add a little bit of Gundam Wing flare, put an android in, and set it in a future a la Final Fantasy 7 or Xenogears, and you have the entire series.

This is a documentary about the making--obviously--of one of the greatest, most influential rock albums ever produced. It doesn't cover every song, though. That's true. But, it does cover, to me, the most important ones on the album. Personally, I like the entire album...but, I can understand why some songs were either glossed over or simply not mentioned, such as Invaders or Total Eclipse. While decent songs...I don't think they make or break the album, honestly.I've watched several other Classic Album episodes over the years...and I think this is probably one of the more enjoyable ones I've ever seen. Like I said, this is about an album that's a sliver in time for a band that's now well-established. Back then, Maiden had a following, true...just not like after this album, just not like today. And I seriously doubt they'd have the success today without The Number of the Beast.Anyway. What you'll get on this disc is everything that went into making the album. All of the trials and tribulations. All of the myths surrounding it--and, yes, some of them are true. Best bits: Bruce talking about the reaction and attention the album's title track got back in the day. Bruce talking about how The Prisoner came into being. Adrian Smith showing guitar parts on certain songs--as well as the stuff he shows that didn't make it into the episode. There are some candid pieces on here, too. Over all. Great stuff.</td>\n",

       "1515619  This video actually focuses mostly on one of the characters that Emmanuelle (Krista Allen) is trying to teach about sex & love.

       "1515627  This episode pretty much has Hafron and Emmanuelle teleporting to different parts of the world and &quot;doing it&quot;. There is the continuing plot from an earlier episode of some group on Earth trying to track them down. That's the main reason for Emmanuelle and Hafron to jump to different parts of the world. Otherwise, this episode is mostly sex scenes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1515636  This is an intimate concert of Robert Mirabal.  Although I thought that it was, as I said, masterful, the sound, at times sounded a little muffled.The storytelling of the songs gave an insight of native culture and of Mirabal's own family stories and history.The Dance and Ee You Oo are my picks for the best songs, but they are all a joy to watch.

       "1515690  Great show from the inventors of the extreme gothic metal genre !! 75'of pure mayhem with good visuals and a great sound, although the vocals are a little high in the mix for my taste and the guitar on the right channel is 10 times louder than the one on the left so I ended up switching it to mono to even things up. It's hard to give this more stars esp. when you've watched the PTSFirepower DVD first like I did, that one is so much better. The 5 bonus videoclips totally rule and round up the package making the purchase a worthy one.Now the mockumentary may not be suited to everyone's tastes, personally it bored me and know of a lot of people who feels it ruins the band's image. Well don't watch it then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1515691  I rented this dvd, i didnt buy it.  I also rented PanDamonAeon and Mannequin.  This dvd has excellent very long concert footage.  Its practically the same songs as on Livebait for the Dead.  And then we have the rest of the dvd.  Im sorry, i love CoF but that \"schockumentary\" thing was just sad.  I could barely stand to watch it.  It's stupid and boring, maybe if theyd shown more of the band in a more coherent manner...and it just goes on and on forever.  This is a 2 hour plus dvd adn half of it is crap.  The \"blair twit Project\" is slightly amusing, but mostly boring.  The music videos are good though.  I would still recommend buying this dvd just for the music videos and the concert footage.  PanDamonAeon gave me more joy though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1515700  Excellent Sound, Excellent Picture, Tons and Tons of songs. Love the Scorched Earth Erotic video. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't think they let their female singer sing enough, it adds a nice goth touch. I also did not give it five stars because it would have been nice to have the \"her ghost in the fog\" video on here, and finally I thin Dani could have done better on some parts of the songs. For example: On \"her ghost in the fog\" (live version), he chooses to growl in that typical death metal voice, instead of talking in the deep gothic voice like he does on the album. By using this growly voice, I think he is cheese'n off some of the songs best parts. Anyway, these are minor gripes and this is a must have DVD, so definitely BUY IT!...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1515701  As most of my friends hate, I'm massively into Cradle of Filth.  In the style of Napoleon Dynamite describing a Liger, I would say \"...they're pretty much my favorite band.\"  Their music is among the worst in the industry, they suck in a way few bands can meaningfully aspire to.  I've seen them live, bought pretty much every t-shirt from every album and tour, and have almost every album that they've released over the last \"decade and a bit\".  I love it, I love it all.  I recently purchased Heavy, Left-Handed, & Candid.  If you don't like Cradle of Filth, then you'll most certainly hate this DVD.  It's absolutely fantastic, full of everything I was hoping for.There is a bunch of documentary type stuff, eleven live performances, a couple of music videos, and a few other \"shorts\" put together by the band.  Another one of the bonus items they threw on the disc is a short movie called \"The Blair Twit Project\".  This is basically footage of the band walking through woodland, filmed entirely using the night-vision mode on a video camera as they follow the trail of \"a pissed northern bastard.\"  Being a \"northerner\" myself, it felt very much like a standard night walking home from the pub on a Friday night being idiots.  It's funny to watch *once*.The DVD is actually really well put together and there is a ton of material included, which is a refreshing change when compared to some other music DVDs I've bought that barely even take the time to put a decent menu together.  As with their music, most people will hate this DVD.  I loved it, but then again, I'm weird.  The live performances are pretty awesome and it has solidified my decision to have to see this band again soon.  I don't know if they come to the US very often if at all, but some guy in Hot Topic assured me that he'd seen them here a few years ago.  I'll have to keep my eyes on the tour dates.  Then the hardest job will be convincing anyone to actually go with me.  My wife say's she's up for it, but I think that will have to be seen to be believed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1515707  This category 3 classic mixes genres like only Hong Kong use to be able to do before the takeover. It over priced because of it's rarity so unless you collect rare Category 3 films you might want to get something else.

       "1515715  Wow, I thought I rambled, but Lau Ching wan takes it to another level!  His character is so complex, and there's so many things that I pick up on in his performance when I rewatch this movie.  I didn't really know how to fit these thoughts into my review, so I thought I would just point it out right away.  That quote above is classic rambling from Lau Ching Wan's character.  I don't know how I didn't get annoyed of his character, but Lau Ching Wan just gives such a great performance.  I kept wanting to hear what he had to say, because the more he rambles on, the more violent he gets with his words.  Great stuff.Lau Ching Wan stars as a gangster who just got out of jail, and right away he gets into a fight.  After his brawl he decides to stay at a really cheap inn run by a poor widow played by Ruby Wong.  They slowly begin a relationship, and I found it well done and touching.  Lau Ching Wan's character is over the top with how rude he is, but he does a great job at it.  I really found myself liking his character, even though his character is supposed to be almost completely unlikeable.  One scene I liked was when Lau Ching Wan literally forces the owner of the inn and her son to go out and have a day of fun with him.  It is quite an odd scene.  So they go out for the day, and do all types of fun things.  For instance Lau Ching Wan shows them what part of a wall he painted while he was in prison. But seriously, there are a lot of good things about this movie.  There's one hilarious scene where Lau throws a big fit screaming at the inn owner that his room has been taken.  He couldn't have been a bigger baby.  She doesn't say a word, politely shows him to his room, and when the door opens, the drunken Lau Ching Wan figures out after a few seconds that he must have been in the wrong room before.  Such a great scene.  There's some more scenes like that, and that's the main reason the movie is worth watching.  Plus you have those great small touches that Johnnie To is known for.  Like when the inn owner is cleaning Lau's room, she sees a big pile of money in his drawer, and she shuts the drawer right away.  Good scene with good character development for both actors.  But then what Johnnie To does is expand on it.  About 4 days pass, and she is cleaning his room, and once again sees his drawer open, but this time that big pile of money is nothing but a few bills.  Like I said, it's just a small touch.While this movie isn't that exciting, and it's anything but original, I loved the directing job, the acting, dialogue,  the short action scenes, and I found myself laughing outloud at least a few times.  Lau Ching Wan + Johnnie To.  How can you go wrong with that?  You can't.  And you also have Lam Suet giving a great performance.  This is back when he actually got good roles.  Nowadays it seems like he just gets really small roles or cameos in Johnnie To movies.  Don't expect a great thriller or something really exciting, just an enjoyable movie.Rating- 4/5The subtitles on the Universe DVD are well written, but they go by a bit too fast most of the time.  Sound is good.  5.1 and 3.0 Cantonese and Mandarin tracks.  And the picture quality isn't exactly HD, but still very good.   \n",
       "1515717  Killer is an okay HK film with a familiar storyline.  Jordan Chan is a well respected hitman who wants to go into legit businesses with his crooked homies.  However, he's trapped in the game and his world is starting to fall apart.  The performances are good and I really cared about the main characters.  Sexy Yoyo Mung is always a treat for my eyes and I was really surprised and thrilled to see Shaw Brothers veteran, Lo Meng as a rival mob boss.  I just wish there was a little more action.  Director Billy Chung should have asked Johnnie To for a few pointers.  With more action scenes and a better ending, this really could have been a Killer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "1515727  Loved it, terrible movie at it's core, but very appealing visually.  Shot well, funny, and slick.  As a fan of the horror genre (I'm of the Halloween and Friday the 13th generation) I'm used to seeing the girls in bikini/underwear/nothing for eyecandy.  This one finally gives the boys a turn, with the male lead jogging shirtless, bending and stretching in long camera shots, and showing off his nice assets.  The head vampire, who obviously adores him, is a hottie as well, and loves to hang out in his underwear with all his friends.  Recommended for a lonely Friday night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1515730  Don't waste any time thinking where is the horror in that flick, fellas.The story of that low, 'low' budget movie is an excuse for delivering underwear homoerotic scenes of some of the most hot young males that the director could find when it shooted the movie.So, if you like any of this like i do, apart from expend a very entertaining corny one and a half hour of your life, there's a great chance that you really enjoy it.Personally, as an horror movies fan, i think that it's time to center the erotic interest of that movies in the males, after passing more than twenty years worshiping the body of women.Apparently, there's a lot of people agreeing with me. As an example, take a look at THE COVENANT, one major studio horror flick that is nothing more that a David Decoteau movie, but with a real 'budget' attached to itAfter all, yes; the movie is cheap.

       "1515750  Based on Hugh Wiley's inscrutable Oriental detective Mr. Wong, Boris Karloff is called upon by his detective friend to solve the murder of undercover detective Dan O'Grady that includes smuggling. James Lee Wong informs Capt. Bill Street (Grant Withers) that he can only help if it has something to do with the Orient.

       "1515763  I always make a point to see Bonnie Raitt live whenever I can. I've caught her in all kinds of venues and she's never disappointed.  She's more of a solid, consistent performer than a blow-you-away performer, but that's hardly a bad thing.  She comes alive onstage and brings a warmth and joy to her performances that her best records can only hint at.  (Not that she doesn't make consistently records--she does.)This 1995 performance tape (and you have to keep in mind that it was originally VHS) captures her and her band at their best.  Yes, the sound could be better, but even in an actual performance setting, you might find yourself complaining about the acoustics a bit.  If the performance is solid, you can begin to overlook a few sound problems. So too with this DVD.Guests like Jackson Browne, Ruth Brown and Charles Brown and even some non-Brown(e)s like Kim Wilson and Bryan Adams add to the special event quality of the performance. And Bruce Hornsby adds his distinctive piano to a couple of numbers.  (\"I Can't Make You Love Me\" is particularly affecting.) But my favorite numbers are those featuring  Bonnie and her great band.  The chemistry between them is palpable.She ain't no amoeba.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1515764  Bonnie is one of my all time favorite artists. I was blown away by the Road Tested CD a few years ago and expected a lot from the DVD. The music, the sound, the stage, the lighting, the registration, the colors are all great indeed, but the editing is all wrong and annoying. A lot of the time the music and film are out of sync, but what is worse is that more than once shots belonging to an other part of the concert are used to fill up gaps elsewhere. I cannot believe that the editor actually thinks that the viewer is stupid enough to fall for these cheap solutions. The mistakes are often so obvious! It is not enough to show, let's say, a drummer who is drumming. NO! We want to see that that drummer is actually playing that particular part of the music that is coming from our speakers at that particular moment.Still, as I said, the concert is great, and the DVD is worth 4 stars; a must have for all her fans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "1515771  Let me start with a few words about Bonnie Raitt.  I first saw her at the Lenox Arts Center in MA in the early '70s, and it is one of those performances that sticks with you.  What a musical performance!  And this woman who commented on the bare-chested guys in the audience (what audacity!).  I have to be honest--haven't followed every recording of her career.  But everytime I hear her I'm floored.  Here's a woman who can belt out a ballad, play the blues, and put the most loving touch on a folk song, to bring you to tears.  Versatility is Raitt.  You want proof!?  Just see her on the Stevie Ray Vaughan tribute belting out &quot;Pride and Joy.&quot;  She takes a guy song and makes it into the quintessential girl's torch song!  All I can say is she made a lot of guys lonely (including me!) when she mentions a husband in the concert.  But hey, we are happy for you Bonnie.But what a minute!  The production on this video just doesn't do Bonnie justice.  I've heard much about the audio problems, and I agree.  But the video doesn't give us fans a chance!  I want something more than 5 seconds of a sustained shot on Bonnie and her guitar.  The music is there, but a bit more of Bonnie, without endless cuts to her band, would be desirable.  (A great band mind you, but nonetheless it couldn't hurt to let us see her a bit more!)I would love to see Bonnie in a proper DVD.  How about it Bonnie!  There're plenty of us out here that would love to hear from you.  You are a legend now, like BB and Buddy.  Put your music on record (in resplendent DVD)!

       "1515781  In intimate conversation with daughter Mary (whose husband directed), Paul McCartney discusses life after the Beatles, and how his next challenge was to form a band, pack up the family, and hit the road.  88 minute film seen on ABC-TV is satisfying for fans but footage shown could have been expanded.  We just get snippets of great songs and rare concert footage, and there isn't any interviews or commentary with the rest of the band (save for Linda's posthumous comments) especially from loyal, talented, long-suffering Denny Laine who was there from start to finish.  DVD extras include an additional 22 minute discussion between Paul and Mary, promotional videos for &quot;Jet&quot; and &quot;Let 'Em In&quot; (which were both taken from the &quot;Rockshow&quot; film) and the superstar jam &quot;Rockestra&quot;.  Just three videos?  Also included is a discography and a photo gallery, with 100 pictures.  A neat package, but they should have alloted themselves more than 88 minutes to cover a nine-year career, especially with all the great music involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1515783  The worst thing I can say about Wingspan is that the title is misleading.  I suspect McCartney and his daughter intended to make a documentary about Wings but ended up with one about Paul and Linda instead.  But that's okay, although they should have changed the name of the DVD.The best feature of Wingspan is that Paul, for once, is remarkably articulate in the interview sections.  The questions are more intimate than you might expect from his own daughter, too.  It can't have been easy for him to talk with her about such issues as the drug bust in Japan - but he does it, apparently quite honestly.  I also loved the early films and stories of the retreat in Scotland immediately before and after the Beatles broke up, and the first Wings tour.  The shots of the 1976 American tour are also terrific - if there's enough footage of those shows for a full-length DVD, everyone who sees this will want to buy it.  Just sayin', guys.  While most fans will already know some of the stories he tells, there are several here that I've never heard before, notably the origin of \"Mrs. Vanderbilt\" and the reggae bridge in \"Live and Let Die.\"  I also came away with a lot more respect for Linda after watching this, even if the fact remains that she couldn't sing.What's not so good is the discussion of the other members of Wings and the band's work as a whole - which, after all, is apparently what the show was supposed to be about in the first place.  With occasional exceptions, the talk about the songs is fairly cursory, and this is even more true when it comes to the musicians.  Denny Laine, the only constant member of Wings besides Paul and Linda (and, on two occasions, the only other member of the band) doesn't get anywhere near the screen time he warrants.  Some of the other members literally only get one mention in passing.  Then again, that is an accurate reflection of how long they were in the group!  Their best-selling album, \"Wings at the Speed of Sound,\" isn't discussed at all and only about a minute's worth of it is even used as background music.  (I can't help wondering if this is Paul and Mary's way of acknowledging that, big as it was, it's not a very good album.)  During the segment on the 1976 tour, he recites a rather obnoxious nursery rhyme he made up in response to questions about a Beatles reunion - without ever mentioning that Ringo turned up at one of the shows and he seemed quite happy about it at the time.  I'd love to know why he left that out.Overall, the good outweighs the bad.  Now, let's see about a full-length Wings concert DVD...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1515795  For this \"rockumentary,\" Paul McCartney is interviewed by his daughter. He is very playful and relaxed, given his familiarity with the interviewer. At the beginning of the program we witness the dissolution of the Beatles and the marriage of Paul and Linda. Interestingly, none of the other Beatles were in attendance at the hastily arranged nuptials. Later, Paul wonders if he can make it as a solo artist. After releasing a couple of solo albums, he decides to form a new band. His wife Linda would be a member of the group, even though she had little musical experience. Paul admired Denny Laine's guitar playing and singing with the Moody Blues.  Denny was asked to join his new group Wings. As it turned out, Denny Laine was the ONLY member of Wings to stay with the group from start to finish, other than Linda. However, his musical contributions - what songs he wrote and sang on, or contributed a guitar solo to - are never discussed. Mr. Laine was not interviewed for this DVD, nor are any clips of old interviews with him included. Other band members are only mentioned in passing although, to be fair, most only lasted with Wings a short time.As Paul said near the end of the program, he proved that he could have major hits and successful world tours with another band after the Beatles. After Paul's infamous drug bust in Japan, he felt that it was time to give everything a rest. Thus Wings ended, not with a bang but with a whimper. Surprisingly, there is no booklet or even an insert included with the DVD. The extras include complete live performances of two songs - \"Jet\" and \"Let 'Em In\" - as well as the studio session for the instrumental \"Rockestra.\" The discography contains mistakes; when you click on the song list for \"Wings Over America\" it displays the song list for \"Wings At The Speed Of Sound.\" A little more attention to detail and interviews with other band members could easily have made this a 5 star DVD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "1515864  I use Three Mo Tenors in my Humanities class to introduce Opera and to my Contemorary Fine Arts classes to demonstrate diversity. It begins with an aria getting the 'Three Tenors' treatment which morphs into various exciting forms of more accessible music like soul, MoTown, gospel, jazz, and blues. These guys are the real deal. Students realize it and generally accept the different forms of music that are so masterfully executed. There is even a touching rendition of \"Nothing's Going to Harm You\" from Sweeney Todd. The secret is to prepare the students to be bored by Opera so that you let them discover the surprize.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Dubs are \"best available source\" and can vary from very good to only fair.In the most interesting made-for-TVer A CHRISTMAS WITHOUT SNOW, a divorcee from Nebraska relocates to San Francisco, where she rediscovers the spirit of Christmas through her inner-city church's choir. Their plans to perform Handel's Messiah are disrupted by vandalism.Zoe Jensen (Learned) temporarily leaves her young son with his worried grandma and heads west to seek a teaching job. With no positions available, Zoe does clerical work at a number of offices. She joins a choir led by taskmaster Ephraim Adams (Houseman). As they rehearse a challenging Christmas concert program, tensions arise within the group.Classically-trained Muriel (Curtin) bristles when she's passed over as solo soprano in favor of an amateur with a much softer voice. Elderly Inez (Nelson), a member for decades, can no longer carry a tune. Mr. Adams deftly handles both these issues, but little can be done when the church's pipe organ is severely damaged by an unknown attacker.A young African-American baritone is arrested by police after being wrongly accused of the crime by another member. Worse, the cheesy electronic organ on 60 days trial keeps receiving police radio calls during mass! With no repair company available in time and their substitute organ malfunctioning, things look pretty bleak. And then, Mr. Adams suffers a stroke...Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.6) A Christmas Without Snow (TV-1980) - Michael Learned/John Houseman/James Cromwell/Valerie Curtin/Calvin Levels/Ruth Nelson/Ed Bogas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "1515876  There was something about this movie that entralled me and stayed in my mind over the last 24 years since I first saw it and I decided to order a copy. The other reviews concerning the product quality alarmed me, I was prepared for the worst but ordered the DVD anyway, I was surprised that it was not nearly as bad as I had expected, I had no trouble viewing the picture or hearing words. I think what appeals to me so much about this story is the sense of Christian community it portrays, a story of several different people struggling with everyday problems, yet coming together and finding fellowship while striving together as the body of Christ to produce a magnificent offering of adoration to the Lord. It inspires me to want to do the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1515880  I loved &#34;The Waltons&#34; as a kid; so I had to see this. It's nothing like The Waltons except that it features Michael Learned. As a bonus you also get the fine performance of John Houseman. No over-the-top acting from this cast! If you like a good story that takes some time to develop, you'll like this. It hits some controversial issues including racial stereotyping with a primary story line that inspires. The characters face a variety of obstacles with deliberation and sensibility. Refreshing departure from the melodrama of the newer holiday movies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1515881  The other reviewers who characterize the story as slow-moving are correct, but this movie is still well worth seeing.  For an obscure made-for-TV movie it's remarkably good -- very humane and thoughtful.  And if you have ever been involved in an amateur choral production, especially of Handel's Messiah, you'll find it deeply touching.  I remembered it years after seeing it, but couldn't recall the title.  Finally looked it up via the actors names (the cast has several notables).  I'm glad I did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1515886  Although I admit part of the fun in watching Christmas movies is that they are so corny, this realistic tale rounds out a Christmas collection nicely.It is about a newly divorced single mom from the midwest trying to make a new start in San Francisco.

       "1515910  It's not about a browbeating choral conductor, and John Houseman and Michael Learned's characters do not quarrel at all.  He is a serious musician, but one who is respectful of the amateurs he is conducting. The Amazon summary of the film sounds like a silly best guess as to what it might be about, but it goes deeper.It is a good film about a divorced, financially-strapped woman spending the holidays alone away from her young son (in San Francisco's warm climate - hence, no snow).  She finds meaning in the relationships she has with members of an urban community choir whose new, esteemed conductor is teaching them The Messiah.  Michael Learned's acting is understated and believable, and I think it is very well acted by everyone, even if the plot is a little predictable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

I thought it was going to be a predicable, already done Christmas movie.  I was wrong. This movie is surprisingly good, not too overdone.  The spirit of Christmas is there, just in a way other films don't capture it.  Watch for the performances of James Cromwell and the late character actor Ramon Bieri.

       "1515949  This movie has all the trappings of a classic western tale enthusiasts have come to expect: gambling in saloons, dancing women, dusty country-weathered men, gun fights and riding off into the sunset. The traveling circus element was great comic relief and I laughed out loud at the scene of 3 or 4 little clowns swinging bats to take down a giant villain! I think folks are judging it to harshly based on the quality of the DVD. I admit, in the beginning the aspect ratio is squeezed together to fit TVs and the picture looks elongated, this is annoying. Then this technique is switched to just chopping of the sides of the wide screen original. Regardless of quality issues, I soon became engrossed in the story and couldn't help but enjoy movie overall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "1515966  I think this is a very underrated series. Most of my friends think Big O [stinks], but I love it, despite some of the obvious drawbacks.First of all, the drawing style [is bad], I admit that. Looks slightly American, and some of the characters are cartoonish, not the realistic portrayal shown by other anime. However, I like how the background and tone is set, expressing the emotionlessness of Paradigm City.The plot rules. Earlier someone mentioned the movie \"Dark City\" in their review, and I think that Dark City and Big O have many things alike. The plot is dark, mysterious, a psychological thriller.I'd recommend this for average anime fans. Most extreme anime otakus don't like this kind of simple style and plot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1515967  First off; that never-produced second season of Big O is finally just around the corner!  The pay-off to season one's pent up pressure will finally be released!  Two years after its American network airing, 'tis 'bout bloody time!I've been catching this series again on Adult Swim as of late, with some of its (mercifully) restored edits.  An aside: This was the anime that *got* me hooked on anime.  A two-year binge thenceforth followed in which I exposed myself to dozens of other series/OAVs/Movies.  Some ja ne sais quoi about Big O in particular just engrossed me.  Mayhaps it'll do the same for you, or already has!The homages to Batman are very overt and at times quite literal: The dapper Bruce Wayne-esque Roger Smith, diplomatic plutocrat by day, maverick vigilantte by night.  Norman, the butler, is the benevolent shadow that assists Roger behind the scenes whilst saving enough time to prepare dinner and turn down the sheets.  Then there's Roger and his grudging relationship of mutual respect with \"legitimate\" law enforcement.  And of course, we have the cartel of deranged villians that Roger has to put up with, each with their own maniacal plan concerning Paradigm City.Big O has its own sylistic flourishes.  Big O ditches the superhero spandex and costumes; Roger Smith is still in his double-breasted suit when he climbs into his megadeuce to save the day; that blond loony Beck is the Joker without the face-paint.  Paradigm City is a semi-inhabited dilapiated metropolis, a crumbling gothic expanse filled with stories of forgotten pasts, people, and events, waiting to be exumed, which in itself is more mysterious and ominous than Gotham City.  And instead of a sidekick, Roger Smith has his charge Dorothy, a well-mannered android debuntante with a red bob in a sensible/elegant black dress who deadpans all her lines.  Yet, she occassionally emotes in an understated fashion that's particularly satisfying in that way that AI creations become, if only for a moment, \"human.\"  Dorothy's scenes of romantic tension betwixt she and Roger are also precious.As for the bad bits of this anime, well, it *is* a mecha-anime after all, which means, sooner or later in the episode, big robots are going to stomp around blowing stuff up.  Occassionally it gets overblown, overlong, and silly.  It's a necessary evil.  Thankfully it's underplayed compared to Big O's mecha breatheren, and the allure of Paradigm City is never compromised.  On the otherhand character development is rather slipshod; new dimensions of Roger Smith don't really crop up (one gets the impression he prefers it this way, considering his views on Paradigm City), and much of the supporting cast are mere caricatures (take the noir-cliche of Angel, the femme fatal with the dangerous past and double-edged motives).  Dorothy is the sole expection here, and the most interesting character.Nutshell: Big O is surprisingly watchable, sometimes mature, sub-noir anime (even if it occassionally apes the vibe of Cowboy Bebop).  A definite gem in the anime mine.  If not a diamond, than definitely, say, an amythest.                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1515968  If your reading this, then you probobly own, or have seen discs 1-3 so i'm not gonna talk aobut the series much, cause by now  you know if you like it or not.  In the series of 4 discs this is the one to see above all others, the last episode sums up a good 75% of everthing thats been happening. IT clears up alot of questions and gives some quick backround into a lot of characters. However the series ends on a monster of a cliffhanger for sure. And thats it. no 2nd season was ever produced, it may someday, but at the moment does not exist. So when it ends, you go..&quot;wow that was cool!But  what the hell's going on?&quot; So you kinda have to use your imagination to end the series. But if you've bought some of the other discs and liked them definately buy this one. The disc is standard fare, the extras, picture and audio are all the same as before. But these are the 3 episodes you should see, they really shed alot of light on the story, as well as create a bunch more questions. The 3 epsiodes are-a threat is brought upon the city promising destruction. it's the xmas episode.-Schzartwald gets himself a mega dues. Not one of those cheezy homeade bots either. this is like another Big O.-Roger smith learns about the past of paradigm, and the same thing that happened 40 years ago happens again.Buy it, love it. get upset at the ending. and write sunrise entertainment and tell them to make more episodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1515973  That's a question I'm sure you'll be asking yourself if you sit down, watch it through to the end, and think about it for a little bit.  This DVD concludes the series with some of the most climactic battles and even a few romantic scenes too.  Though the series was brief, nontheless, it was a classic in my opinion.  Pretty much, take Batman's character, add a little bit of Gundam Wing flare, put an android in, and set it in a future a la Final Fantasy 7 or Xenogears, and you have the entire series.  I suggest that you see it for yourself, to understand what I mean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "1515984  This is a definite must have for any Maiden fan. Okay, it's not perfect. But, you have to look at what this is--this isn't a documentary really about Maiden as a band. This is a documentary about the making--obviously--of one of the greatest, most influential rock albums ever produced. It doesn't cover every song, though. That's true. But, it does cover, to me, the most important ones on the album. Personally, I like the entire album...but, I can understand why some songs were either glossed over or simply not mentioned, such as Invaders or Total Eclipse. While decent songs...I don't think they make or break the album, honestly.I've watched several other Classic Album episodes over the years...and I think this is probably one of the more enjoyable ones I've ever seen. Like I said, this is about an album that's a sliver in time for a band that's now well-established. Back then, Maiden had a following, true...just not like after this album, just not like today. And I seriously doubt they'd have the success today without The Number of the Beast.Anyway. What you'll get on this disc is everything that went into making the album. All of the trials and tribulations. All of the myths surrounding it--and, yes, some of them are true. Best bits: Bruce talking about the reaction and attention the album's title track got back in the day. Bruce talking about how The Prisoner came into being. Adrian Smith showing guitar parts on certain songs--as well as the stuff he shows that didn't make it into the episode. There are some candid pieces on here, too. Over all. Great stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1515987  I thought this was a very in depth examination of one of the greatest metal albums ever made. The extras are cool too. Adrian Smith shows the chord progressions of a few of the classics. Well Done....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1515989  This dvd highlights each song of the Number of the Beast album from beginning to end. This play the original songs with interruption of comments like the storys behind the songs, the interviews.I liked too much the sneek peek at the new Rock in Rio DVD, is really worth to buy it !.It was also nice to see old drummer Clive Burr, and I was saddened by his illness. I would like to see a recopilation of the life of the other members like Paul Di Anno...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1515991  I was really hesitant to buy this. I thought it was going to be a bunch of videos I'd already seen, with a tiny amount of interviews that would bore me. It turned out to be really worth the money. The interviews were very interesting......not the same (...) you read in magazines. There was concert footage I'd never seen before. The coolest part was watching Martin Birch mixing some of the old songs from the record. It's fascinating to hear individual tracks solo'd out. Adrian Smith also plays for you a little. All in all, this is worth buying if you're an Iron Maiden fan. I wish VH1 would do a \"Behind The Music\" episode on this legendary band. They seem like great guys, and I think it would make for good TV....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "      <td>In the book The Official Godzilla Compendium, King Kong Vs Godzilla is described as \"The Jaws of the Japanese film Industry\" or \"One of the great monster battles of cinema history\". It is referred to as the film that \"...Lifted Godzilla from the swelling ranks of interchangeable atomic monsters of the fifties and placed him among the pantheon of cinema creatures\". Thus, I had high expectations when I watched this on the Sci-Fi channel.All I have to say is: Wow! The special effects are incredible! The acting is top notch. The screenplay is well written. This film is truly a classic of cinema that will leave you thinking long after you leave the theater.Wait. That's my review for 2001: A Space Odyssey.Here's what I really think of King Kong vs. Godzilla.A thousand words cannot describe my dislike of the film. I know it's a Godzilla film, but did it need to be this bad? It starts off good, with an excellent piece of music at the beginning credits. But soon goes downhill as we are introduced to U.N Reporter Eric Carter. All he was put in for was to make the film longer and annoy us. He \"communicates\" with people in Japan via a satellite that looks more like a first grade science project than visual effects. He constantly tells us that \"Godzilla is heading for Japan\" or \"King Kong and Godzilla will battle.\" Duh! What do you think King Kong and Godzilla will do? Have tea and crumpets?Speaking of Kong, I have seen costumes that look better than this Kong suit. I would also rather listen to Celine Dion and Elton John do a music number together than listen to Kong roar. He doesn't even open his mouth! Godzilla appears just fine, except for the fact he's afraid of thermal energy (Didn't he tear down an electrical fence in 1954 with ease?). Kong however gets power from the thermal energy. Gee, I would assume that all his fur would make him the perfect conductor of elctricity. Also, doesn't anyone else notice that the islands of the first Godzilla movies (The '50s to the '70s) always look the same? The main battles themselves are also letdowns.It was a grand idea that Toho had: Pitting two titans of cinema against each other. Too bad the Japanese did not use stop motion animation. Or make a Kong/Godzilla rematch. Or make better costumes or etc, etc. For a true classic of monster cinema, King Kong, the original Godzilla or Godzilla 1985 are better choices than this pile of ... If this was the film that made Godzilla famous, he should have been assassinated.Indeed this film will leave you thinking after you leave the theater: Why did I waste my time on this?(Note: Perhaps my criticism was a bit harsh. After all, this is the American version of the movie and we always [mess] with perfection. Maybe the Japanese version is better. Get that one if you can).</td>\n",

       "861729  In the book The Official Godzilla Compendium, King Kong Vs Godzilla is described as \"The Jaws of the Japanese film Industry\" or \"One of the great monster battles of cinema history\". It is referred to as the film that \"...Lifted Godzilla from the swelling ranks of interchangeable atomic monsters of the fifties and placed him among the pantheon of cinema creatures\". Thus, I had high expectations when I watched this on the Sci-Fi channel.All I have to say is: Wow! The special effects are incredible! The acting is top notch. The screenplay is well written. This film is truly a classic of cinema that will leave you thinking long after you leave the theater.Wait. That's my review for 2001: A Space Odyssey.Here's what I really think of King Kong vs. Godzilla.A thousand words cannot describe my dislike of the film. I know it's a Godzilla film, but did it need to be this bad? It starts off good, with an excellent piece of music at the beginning credits. But soon goes downhill as we are introduced to U.N Reporter Eric Carter. All he was put in for was to make the film longer and annoy us. He \"communicates\" with people in Japan via a satellite that looks more like a first grade science project than visual effects. He constantly tells us that \"Godzilla is heading for Japan\" or \"King Kong and Godzilla will battle.\" Duh! What do you think King Kong and Godzilla will do? Have tea and crumpets?Speaking of Kong, I have seen costumes that look better than this Kong suit. I would also rather listen to Celine Dion and Elton John do a music number together than listen to Kong roar. He doesn't even open his mouth! Godzilla appears just fine, except for the fact he's afraid of thermal energy (Didn't he tear down an electrical fence in 1954 with ease?). Kong however gets power from the thermal energy. Gee, I would assume that all his fur would make him the perfect conductor of elctricity. Also, doesn't anyone else notice that the islands of the first Godzilla movies (The '50s to the '70s) always look the same? The main battles themselves are also letdowns.It was a grand idea that Toho had: Pitting two titans of cinema against each other. Too bad the Japanese did not use stop motion animation. Or make a Kong/Godzilla rematch. Or make better costumes or etc, etc. For a true classic of monster cinema, King Kong, the original Godzilla or Godzilla 1985 are better choices than this pile of ... If this was the film that made Godzilla famous, he should have been assassinated.Indeed this film will leave you thinking after you leave the theater: Why did I waste my time on this?(Note: Perhaps my criticism was a bit harsh. After all, this is the American version of the movie and we always [mess] with perfection. Maybe the Japanese version is better. Get that one if you can).   \n",
