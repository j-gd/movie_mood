She's somewhat brash, a bit arrogant, sure of herself, seems to have a somewhat love-hate relationship with DD and doesn't seem to care to like Figures much at all.  In fact, she wants to finish off the Maguar on her own without having to resort to becoming a Figure or having Figure 17 help in the fight.Tsubasa and Hikaru are involved in a few minor battles in these two episodes, but the majority of the time is devoted to further character development.  We spend a lot of time with the two girls and their friends as they have a camp out at the school, where they cook curry and investigate the school in the dark.  The second episode is mostly about life on the farm as the two girls help out with chores when the farm owners wife gets sick.These episdoes are slow paced and might not appeal to someone who only likes action, but I found them a nice change of pace from some of the more frenetic shows out there.  It's nice to be able to sit back and watch the characters grow and blossom as Tsubasa is drawn more out of her shell by the more outgoing Hikaru.Also, we're introduced to a reporter in these episodes who seems to notice that there are unusual things going on in the vicinity, what with all the battles that have been going on with the Maguar.  I'm anxious to see what further developments will come up in further volumes.  Check them out, they are definitely worth your time.</td>\n",

Unlike DD she scorns the help of Figure 17, and believes she can take care of the bug hunt on her own. Boy, is she wrong, because the Maguar have mutated due to the alien environment of Earth, and their weapons no longer hurt them. In much the same way Hikaru's abilities when merged with Tsubasa increase and are the only sure bet to destroy the Maguar. There's very little battle time in this second volume, and that's a good thing. There's really nothing special in the combat part of this anime. It's in the time spent on Tsubasa and Hikaru that the real heart of the show lies. In the first episode, the girls have an overnight camp sleep-out on the grounds of their school, and Tsubasa gets a little more interaction with her crush. In the second episode, the girls have to help out their aunt after an illness prevents her from helping out on the farm. Their auntie's real problem may be with her daughter Sakura's failure to help her and overall disregard for the work that her family does.I love the characters of Tsubasa and Hikaru because they are so sweet and good-natured. There really isn't a Heart of Darkness here. The director of the show even says there is nothing complicated here, and that he just wants you to enjoy the show.His mission has been accomplished! The animation is film quality and it really shows in the two leads facial expressions and movement. While some may find the story overly cute I like it. Great characters!

But the audio is in nowhere as bad a shape as, say, the Andy Williams Christmas specials from around the same time--and those were featured on PBS in recent years.  The video quality is good--if you're old enough to remember what TV looked like in the early Seventies.  It may not be as sharp as some digital show produced for your 60\" plasma TV, but let's not get greedy, okay?The show itself features Ellington with his re-assembled big band, and some young jazz singers.  Most all the brass gets to have a turn in the spotlight.  There's even a flute featured in one song.  A bombastic drum solo reminds us that this is the era of classic rock.Ben Webster has the stage mannerism of a deaf man--glancing around, paying no mind to Ellington's stage patter, keeping an impassive face.  Nothing wrong with what comes out of his horn, though.A neat contrast in styles for jazz fans occurs on one ballad, featuring first Paul Gonsalves.  Gonsalves really milks it, getting his shoulders into his performance, wringing all the soul out of that lovely melody.  Ben Webster plays the song next for an encore.  His performance is more reserved and cool, but one's left thinking that maybe he may have dug the deepest after all.  The only comparable contrast I can think of is Flip Phillips and Charlie Parker going head-to-head on one of the Jazz At The Philharmonic cds.Ellington looks dapper in a crisp suit, his only concession to the times--the early Seventies--being a ridiculous little mullet curling over his collar.  He's got the crowd in the palm of his hand throughout.  His stage patter is a little prolix, mixing scat &amp; hepcat anachronisms with some current events observations.  He seems a little stiff moving around the stage, but his piano playing is astounding; the dvd box copy kids you not.Ellington's piano playing is wonderful, running through a lifetime worth of moods and styles.  One moment his playing is all starlight and bouquets, then some toe-tappin' swing, and then abstract jazz (though he didn't like to call his music that) of almost Monkish obliqueness.  But he never forgets and never fails to show the audience a good time.  I wonder if the rapt Danish crowd in the theater knew how good they had it.  It certainly must have been very different from the audiences Duke played for in the Twenties.The whole show is a wonderful treasure, and I hope to explore more of this series at Tivoli.</td>\n",

And the most compelling aspect of it (to me) is the timing of when it was produced. It was made within weeks or months of JFK's assassination, and debuted in a Milwaukee theater (incredibly) on April 22, 1964, which was a point in time when the Warren Commission hadn't even come close to finishing its investigation into the President's murder.I've watched the Buchanan trial film several times, and there are very few blatant errors in the movie. One mistake is when the prosecutor elicits testimony from a witness that indicated that all three of the bullets that were fired by Lee Oswald during the assassination were recovered and were in evidence at the trial.Another major error contained in the film is when the actor portraying one of JFK's autopsy doctors says that the bullet which entered JFK's upper back did not exit his body, and that the throat wound was a result of a fragmented portion of the bullet that struck the President's head.But those errors regarding the President's wounds are understandable from the point-of-view of the filmmakers, due to the lack of additional information concerning the facts which overwhelmingly support the Single-Bullet Theory, which is information that Buchanan did not have by the time his low-budget film was rushed into theaters in April of '64.And Buchanan was also undoubtedly relying on the erroneous initial report written by FBI agents Sibert and O'Neill, who attended President Kennedy's autopsy. The official autopsy report, however, corrected the mistake that appears in the early FBI report, with the autopsy report clearly stating that the bullet that entered JFK's upper back \"made its exit through the anterior surface of the neck\" [Warren Report; Page 543].All things considered, Larry Buchanan's \"The Trial Of Lee Harvey Oswald\" is remarkably accurate in most of the details pertaining to the death of JFK. And one of the most refreshing things about the movie is that Lee Oswald is not perceived by the defense to be an innocent patsy who was framed to take the fall by evil and unknown outside forces. Even Oswald's own lawyer concedes the possibility (or even the probability) of his client being guilty of killing the President. Otherwise, there would have been no need for the defense to have entered an additional plea of \"Not guilty by reason of existing insanity\".One additional note -- One of the witnesses in the Buchanan film is played by real assassination eyewitness James Altgens. He doesn't play himself, however.(I have no comment on the Bonnie &amp; Clyde feature which shares this DVD with the Oswald trial film. I haven't watched that B&amp;C; program, and probably never will. I purchased this disc solely for \"The Trial Of Lee Harvey Oswald\".)David Von PeinFebruary 2012</td>\n",

       "      <td>\"Heart of the Rio Grande\" (1942) is probably the most lyrical of Autry's movies and therefore has held up better than his more action oriented films. When ranch owner Skipper Forbes hires Gene as her new foreman, the old foreman Hap Callahan (William Haade) is allowed to stay on as a ranch hand. Hap resents Gene and his plans for turning the place into a dude ranch. There is a lot of friction between them culminating in a fight and Hap's dismissal. He plots revenge.Early in the film a girls' school arrives at the dude ranch for the summer. The teacher Alice Bennett (Fay McKenzie) serves as both Gene's tame romantic interest and his sidekick Frog's (Smiley Burnett) unrequited love. Their dueling serenade of Alice is the best of a whole bunch of pretty good musical elements in the film.All the girl students look about high school age which gives the film a lot of charm that would be missing if they had populated the cast with 20 something starlets. The most prominent of the students is Connie Lane (Edith Fellows best known as Polly Pepper in all those Pepper films of the 30's), the spoiled daughter of a rich businessman. At first Connie makes a lot of trouble for everyone but eventually she takes to Gene and works to improve his opinion of her.Burnette can lay claim to originating the mini-me concept. In \"Heart of the Rio Grande\" Frog Millhouse is shadowed by a fat little boy, appropriately named Tadpole (Joe Strauch, Jr.). Tadpole dresses just like Frog including the same hat style (front brim turned up). He has a lot of precocious lines and a very bass singing voice. Jean Porter plays another of the students (mysteriously named Pudge) and soon becomes young Tadpole's first crush. The vivacious Porter is drop dead gorgeous, in the image of Vargas redhead Jean Dean.\"Heart of the Rio Grande\" is mostly music and comedy, what action there is consists almost entirely of Gene rescuing Connie from an assortment of dangers. This is not a bad thing.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</td>\n",

This version is also a satire of the British aristocracy and culture.This was made for the BBC as a Christmas special in 1966.The soundtrack is by Ravi Shankar.  The cast is composed of some of the best known names of British comedy and theatre. Among the cast Peter Cook  plays the Mad Hatter,  Peter Sellers is the King of Hearts, But the real scene stealer is Leo McKern as the Duchess(!).All in all, this is a pretty dark version of the story.

       "      <td>This 1966 BBC-TV version of Lewis Carroll's classic story is, no doubt, one of the more strange and unusual versions of this tale that one is ever likely to see on film.  Filmed in black and white, and given a Victorian Gothic look; director Jonathan Miller voted against the usual presentation of talking animals and flashy visuals.  Instead, he presents a Wonderland firmly rooted in reality as seen through the distorted vision of a child's dream.  Instead of a fuzzy White Rabbit hopping hurriedly to keep his appointment, we get a fussy, hyper, and wild-eyed Victorian gentleman in white top hat and coat with bristling mutton-chop sideburns and mustache.  Also, some of Alice's dialogue is presented as a voice-over, as if we're reading her thoughts.  Alice herself rarely looks anyone in the eye and the conversations are very fractured.  Even her classic conversation with the Cheshire Cat leaves a sense of discomfort as we only see Alice, and not the Cat,during the scene.  Indeed, this Wonderland is a dark and sinister place compared to the brightly colored versions of Disney and Hallmark.For the most part, the cast of this version reads like a Who's Who of British theatre and film.  Peter Cook makes for a delightfully daft Mad Hatter, while Peter Sellers makes for a loopy King of Hearts.  Sir John Gielgud is a dignified Mock Turtle, while Sir Michael Redgrave is a wonderfully pedantic Caterpillar.  Anne-Marie Mallik is solid as a somewhat distant Alice.  Leo McKern is definitely fun to watch as he cavorts in drag as the ugly Duchess.  Ravi Shankar's score perfectly captures the mood of this dark and wonderful film.This DVD also has insightful commentary by the director, as well as an early 1906 silent film version of the story.  Overall, this is an excellent film version that captures the darker elements of Carroll's classic tale and is definitely worth your while.  However, this version might not appeal to youngsters who may be more inclined to the Disney or Hallmark versions.</td>\n",

Whether it's \"The Bicycle Thief\", \"Two Women\" or \"Umberto D.\" De Sica's films make us care about his characters. We have a full emotional investment in what happens to them.\"A Brief Vacation\" tells the story of Clara (Florinda Bolkan) a housewife, with 3 children, who lives with her mother and brother in-law. Clara is the only one who works, since her husband was in an accident and broke his leg. But still she is expected to do for everyone and remain unappreicated. For some reason I thought of my mother while watching this movie. She too on many occasions said she never has time for herself because she's busy doing for others.As the film goes on we find out that Clara is sick, due to the unsafe enviroment of the factory she works at. In a very telling scene notice the reaction of her family as they try to convince her the doctor was trying to scare her. The doctor recommends that Clara go for a rest. If her condition does not improve she may die.Once away Clara doesn't want to leave. It's not that she doesn't care about her family, but, she has never done anything for herself, and finds that she enjoys her time alone. But reality will soon set in. And end her happiness.I suppose in a worst case scenario \"A Brief Vacation\" could have been a cliche, overly sentimental sobfest. But De Sica and Bolkan give the film a genuine feel. We accept Clara and her problems, mostly because we can relate to her situation. As I said before I thought of my mother, other may have the same experience.De Sica had died a year before this film was released in America, but remained one of the key figures in the Italian neo-realism movement. His films of course did more than simply tell a good story. Like the best films they were insights into their times. His films were a reflection of the social and political developments. Just as Rainer Werner Fassbinder made films dealing with Germany in post WW2 years so did De Sica with \"The Bicyle Thief\", \"Two Women\", and \"The Garden of the Finzi-Continis\" (during WW2).\"A Brief Vacation\" has become an obscure title. It is not available on vhs and only recently has been released on DVD. Hopefully many people will discover this De Sica masterpiece.Bottom-line: One of Vittorio De Sica's best films on par with \"The Bicyle Thief\" and \"Two Women\". Extremely involving.</td>\n",

De Sica takes a story and follows it throw it's course without a lot of over the top melodrama or forced contrivances.  It's a quite film that explores the life of a woman trapped in a life she really isn't happy in and has no way out.  Florinda Bolkan is quite good and the supporting cast is reminiscent of the days when Italian directors used real people in their films rather than actors.  And the piece is completely believable.

Scott or Albert Finney...(I won't even discuss the travesty of Jim Carrey's performance).What makes this version so different and exciting is that we encounter the well known story afresh - Anton Lesser plays the role of Charles Dickens himself and merely recites the story before a small group of friends at Christmas. But this is anything but a routine, boring recitation. For the first time, many will encounter the story just as it was written and they can use their imaginations to create a Scrooge in their own minds...or a Jacob Marley...or a Tiny Tim...or the Ghost of Christmas Present.

The standout episode for me is BraveAlan, where he meets a character with similar character traits. Remember the scene in the Car Park where he sees Dan and tries to shout at him to catch his attention. Dan, Dan, Dan! DAN! DAN!! Utterly brilliant.The extras are well worth seeing, but sadly there is no Steve Coogan on the commentaries, which is a real shame. The first series had Coogan and the commentaries were almost as good as the shows themselves. However the spoof TV interview/documentary is very good and some of the outtakes are worth catching.So all said and done its not quite the classic that series 1 was, but its close, and I seem to be enjoying it more each time I see it.</td>\n",

I'm so hungry for what I can do with my little guy that I'm buying and reading and viewing everything I can get my hands on.  I really liked Aimee Ketchum's DVD. It had SO much more information in it and she is extremely qualified and seems like a nice mommy who really cares about children. Very kind.  Her massage part is great and she gives so much information on how to interact naturally with baby to improve development that I'm so happy I found her dvd.  It's much more inexpensive than the other dvd and vhs tapes I've viewed, given the tons of information she gives.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This movie is a sleeper!  Why I've never heard of it before, I have no idea.  Geraldine Page is outstanding, and the story line is poignant and wistful.  It takes us back to earlier times and joy in the simplest of traditions.  I sincerely hope some TV Channel will pick it up this year (2009).  Time to give \"It's A Wonderful Life\" a rest.My only personal disappointment was that Truman Capote narrates it.  He DOES have an annoying voice.  Still, Geraldine Page's performance more than makes up for it.I enthusiastically recommend this DVD !!</td>\n",

       "1778622  I loved the whole series it was great, the characters were all interesting. The only thing that angered me was that they built up this whole final battle thing and when it finally happened it was all of like 1 minute. Also it was one of those typical anime type endings with all the emotional you are in my heart along with this dead person and that dead person type of talk and suddenly the bad guys are defeated. Give me a break I want a real ending for once in an anime. All complaints about the ending aside this series was awesome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1778629  These final episodes of the series are good, but not great.  I won't give away the ending but it definetly gives the feel that the writers weren't really sure how to pull everything together to get a conclusion one way or another.  The action is amazing, and the graphics are, as always, superb.  I would recommend it to anyone viewing the series because, well, it's the end.  Maybe you'll get more understanding about the resolution than I did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1778638  In these two episodes, another character is introduced, another alien who has come to give assistance to DD in destryoing the rest of the Maguar.  She's somewhat brash, a bit arrogant, sure of herself, seems to have a somewhat love-hate relationship with DD and doesn't seem to care to like Figures much at all.  In fact, she wants to finish off the Maguar on her own without having to resort to becoming a Figure or having Figure 17 help in the fight.Tsubasa and Hikaru are involved in a few minor battles in these two episodes, but the majority of the time is devoted to further character development.  We spend a lot of time with the two girls and their friends as they have a camp out at the school, where they cook curry and investigate the school in the dark.  The second episode is mostly about life on the farm as the two girls help out with chores when the farm owners wife gets sick.These episdoes are slow paced and might not appeal to someone who only likes action, but I found them a nice change of pace from some of the more frenetic shows out there.  It's nice to be able to sit back and watch the characters grow and blossom as Tsubasa is drawn more out of her shell by the more outgoing Hikaru.Also, we're introduced to a reporter in these episodes who seems to notice that there are unusual things going on in the vicinity, what with all the battles that have been going on with the Maguar.  I'm anxious to see what further developments will come up in further volumes.

Unlike DD she scorns the help of Figure 17, and believes she can take care of the bug hunt on her own. Boy, is she wrong, because the Maguar have mutated due to the alien environment of Earth, and their weapons no longer hurt them. In much the same way Hikaru's abilities when merged with Tsubasa increase and are the only sure bet to destroy the Maguar. There's very little battle time in this second volume, and that's a good thing. There's really nothing special in the combat part of this anime. It's in the time spent on Tsubasa and Hikaru that the real heart of the show lies. In the first episode, the girls have an overnight camp sleep-out on the grounds of their school, and Tsubasa gets a little more interaction with her crush. In the second episode, the girls have to help out their aunt after an illness prevents her from helping out on the farm. Their auntie's real problem may be with her daughter Sakura's failure to help her and overall disregard for the work that her family does.I love the characters of Tsubasa and Hikaru because they are so sweet and good-natured. There really isn't a Heart of Darkness here. The director of the show even says there is nothing complicated here, and that he just wants you to enjoy the show.His mission has been accomplished! The animation is film quality and it really shows in the two leads facial expressions and movement. While some may find the story overly cute I like it. Great characters! There are about 25 minutes of extras about the making of the show and a promotional video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1778644  Not quite finished yet (it's 3 dvds). Like what I've seen so far.

       "1778667  This 3-disc set is a fantastic overview of a great progressive German band. It contains 2 feature-length films (a documentary and a portrait), a 52 minute live concert, numerous biographies and an historical essay. Plus a short film by Brian Eno. The third disc is comprised of recent material by the band members (albeit individually). I love Can and I love this DVD! If you don't, you probably won't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1778676  This dvd is a musical feast.  The recording is bottom-heavy and out of balance.  This especially hurts on \"Quadruped\", when the four saxophones cannot be heard clearly.  But the audio is in nowhere as bad a shape as, say, the Andy Williams Christmas specials from around the same time--and those were featured on PBS in recent years.  The video quality is good--if you're old enough to remember what TV looked like in the early Seventies.  It may not be as sharp as some digital show produced for your 60\" plasma TV, but let's not get greedy, okay?The show itself features Ellington with his re-assembled big band, and some young jazz singers.  Most all the brass gets to have a turn in the spotlight.  There's even a flute featured in one song.  A bombastic drum solo reminds us that this is the era of classic rock.Ben Webster has the stage mannerism of a deaf man--glancing around, paying no mind to Ellington's stage patter, keeping an impassive face.  Nothing wrong with what comes out of his horn, though.A neat contrast in styles for jazz fans occurs on one ballad, featuring first Paul Gonsalves.  Gonsalves really milks it, getting his shoulders into his performance, wringing all the soul out of that lovely melody.  Ben Webster plays the song next for an encore.  His performance is more reserved and cool, but one's left thinking that maybe he may have dug the deepest after all.  The only comparable contrast I can think of is Flip Phillips and Charlie Parker going head-to-head on one of the Jazz At The Philharmonic cds.Ellington looks dapper in a crisp suit, his only concession to the times--the early Seventies--being a ridiculous little mullet curling over his collar.  He's got the crowd in the palm of his hand throughout.  His stage patter is a little prolix, mixing scat & hepcat anachronisms with some current events observations.  He seems a little stiff moving around the stage, but his piano playing is astounding; the dvd box copy kids you not.Ellington's piano playing is wonderful, running through a lifetime worth of moods and styles.  One moment his playing is all starlight and bouquets, then some toe-tappin' swing, and then abstract jazz (though he didn't like to call his music that) of almost Monkish obliqueness.  But he never forgets and never fails to show the audience a good time.  I wonder if the rapt Danish crowd in the theater knew how good they had it.  It certainly must have been very different from the audiences Duke played for in the Twenties.The whole show is a wonderful treasure, and I hope to explore more of this series at Tivoli.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "1778692  This is a fun \"B\" movie and Michelle, Brinke and Linnea are in top form!The two audio commentaries are fun to listen to.  The Director starts off a bit serious, but becomes hysterical with laughter by the film's end.  \"Nightmare Sisters\" is a return to the glory days of low budget film making.  The production techniques are quite clever!The audio commentary with Brinke and Michelle is very revealing.  During the famous bathtub scene, Brinke manages to plug the latest movie she made with Linnea Quigley,\"Corpses are Forever.\"What product placement!It is also the only film where the Skirts have a song on the soundtrack, \"Santa Monica Blvd. Boy.\"\"Nightmare Sisters\" is for anyone with a sense of humor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "1778705  A somewhat rarely-seen \"mock trial\" that is actually quite good is Larry Buchanan's 1964 courtroom movie, \"The Trial Of Lee Harvey Oswald\" (not to be confused with the Lorne Greene/Ben Gazzara1977 TV movie of the same title).If President Kennedy's assassin had not himself been murdered just two days after JFK was killed in Dallas in November 1963, then many of the scenes we see played out in this simulated trial just might have actually taken place inside a real courtroom in Dallas, Texas, in the year 1964.Buchanan's black-and-white film, which occupies half of this DVD, is very interesting. And the most compelling aspect of it (to me) is the timing of when it was produced. It was made within weeks or months of JFK's assassination, and debuted in a Milwaukee theater (incredibly) on April 22, 1964, which was a point in time when the Warren Commission hadn't even come close to finishing its investigation into the President's murder.I've watched the Buchanan trial film several times, and there are very few blatant errors in the movie. One mistake is when the prosecutor elicits testimony from a witness that indicated that all three of the bullets that were fired by Lee Oswald during the assassination were recovered and were in evidence at the trial.Another major error contained in the film is when the actor portraying one of JFK's autopsy doctors says that the bullet which entered JFK's upper back did not exit his body, and that the throat wound was a result of a fragmented portion of the bullet that struck the President's head.But those errors regarding the President's wounds are understandable from the point-of-view of the filmmakers, due to the lack of additional information concerning the facts which overwhelmingly support the Single-Bullet Theory, which is information that Buchanan did not have by the time his low-budget film was rushed into theaters in April of '64.And Buchanan was also undoubtedly relying on the erroneous initial report written by FBI agents Sibert and O'Neill, who attended President Kennedy's autopsy. The official autopsy report, however, corrected the mistake that appears in the early FBI report, with the autopsy report clearly stating that the bullet that entered JFK's upper back \"made its exit through the anterior surface of the neck\" [Warren Report; Page 543].All things considered, Larry Buchanan's \"The Trial Of Lee Harvey Oswald\" is remarkably accurate in most of the details pertaining to the death of JFK. And one of the most refreshing things about the movie is that Lee Oswald is not perceived by the defense to be an innocent patsy who was framed to take the fall by evil and unknown outside forces. Even Oswald's own lawyer concedes the possibility (or even the probability) of his client being guilty of killing the President. Otherwise, there would have been no need for the defense to have entered an additional plea of \"Not guilty by reason of existing insanity\".One additional note -- One of the witnesses in the Buchanan film is played by real assassination eyewitness James Altgens. He doesn't play himself, however.(I have no comment on the Bonnie & Clyde feature which shares this DVD with the Oswald trial film. I haven't watched that B&C; program, and probably never will. I purchased this disc solely for \"The Trial Of Lee Harvey Oswald\".)David Von PeinFebruary 2012   \n",
       "1778711  \"Heart of the Rio Grande\" (1942) is probably the most lyrical of Autry's movies and therefore has held up better than his more action oriented films. When ranch owner Skipper Forbes hires Gene as her new foreman, the old foreman Hap Callahan (William Haade) is allowed to stay on as a ranch hand. Hap resents Gene and his plans for turning the place into a dude ranch. There is a lot of friction between them culminating in a fight and Hap's dismissal. He plots revenge.Early in the film a girls' school arrives at the dude ranch for the summer. The teacher Alice Bennett (Fay McKenzie) serves as both Gene's tame romantic interest and his sidekick Frog's (Smiley Burnett) unrequited love. Their dueling serenade of Alice is the best of a whole bunch of pretty good musical elements in the film.All the girl students look about high school age which gives the film a lot of charm that would be missing if they had populated the cast with 20 something starlets. The most prominent of the students is Connie Lane (Edith Fellows best known as Polly Pepper in all those Pepper films of the 30's), the spoiled daughter of a rich businessman. At first Connie makes a lot of trouble for everyone but eventually she takes to Gene and works to improve his opinion of her.Burnette can lay claim to originating the mini-me concept. In \"Heart of the Rio Grande\" Frog Millhouse is shadowed by a fat little boy, appropriately named Tadpole (Joe Strauch, Jr.). Tadpole dresses just like Frog including the same hat style (front brim turned up). He has a lot of precocious lines and a very bass singing voice. Jean Porter plays another of the students (mysteriously named Pudge) and soon becomes young Tadpole's first crush. The vivacious Porter is drop dead gorgeous, in the image of Vargas redhead Jean Dean.\"Heart of the Rio Grande\" is mostly music and comedy, what action there is consists almost entirely of Gene rescuing Connie from an assortment of dangers. This is not a bad thing.Then again, what do I know?

       "1778719  This disk has what I think are at least 3 of the most interesting programs in the set. 1961-ish, Martin Sheen doing his best James Dean, pimply Peter Fonda, and super cute Tuesday Weld will make your day. All those great old cars seen on the street scenes, spectators leaning out of windows of their apartment buildings, or gathering on the streets to watch the filming, back in the day when location filming for TV was kind of new. I also own the 'Naked City Portrait of a Painter' disk which I like a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1778742  there is a difference in style, vocal and presentation between British and american, but this is really worth it.  Dame Judy Dench in long wig doing &quot;Sixteen&quot; is FUNNY.  &quot;10 cents a dance&quot; is it the song, the singer, or the dress?  Ruth Henshall, Claire Moore and most of the rest are new to me, but that is the fun part.  And Aunt Ellers comment on Hugh Jackman from Oklahoma rehearsals, well I won't spoil it.

       "1778767  The shows rock harder than you assume a band known for \"80s snyth pop\" would. Terri's voice live is incredible and is an underrated singer. I was literally dragged to the show,expecting to see a washed up band. What I got was a band that sounded potent and current, with Terri putting on a show with unbelievable energy and charisma, who looks like she was cyrogenically frozen in 1988 and released yesterday. Go to the show if you don't believe me. The DVD is going to be \"Storytellers\" style, and doing some of the songs acoustic (it actually works) with the original members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "1778784  For those unfamiliar, the Bikini Bandits is a regular staple of short films from atomfilms.com. The movie is a collection of 3 or 4 of these type of shorts, with snippits of false advertisments in between. The first time through watching this, I felt it was hard to watch, but after the initial adjustment I came to love it. What makes this film all the more brilliant is that all of these idiot tool fans latched on to it simply due to Maynard's role as Satan, and then hated the movie. They get what they deserve. Maynard isn't god, Maynard is just a nerd who likes Star Trek (check t.d.n. if you don't believe me) So, is this for Maynardites? Hell no. This is for fans of true avant-garde cinema. Featuring cameos by Corey Feldman (who drops a reference to realultimatepower.net), Jello Biafria (Dead Kennedys), Dee Dee Ramone (the Ramones), and a surprise cameo as extras by Phil and Bam Margera, and Ryan Dunn. The only real issue I had with this dvd are the phone conversations between segments. I don't know if they were meant to be funny or what, but they're annoying and I would have liked to have done without them. But beggars can't be choosers.

       "1778792  What can I say other than a Ramone playing the POPE? I know, MAYNARD playing the devil!!! Maynard not only a great singer(we're talking great) but is a fairly decent actor! The acting overall is sub-par, the plot is a bit iffy, however, isn't it worth 4 stars just to see the great Maynard act, Dee Dee play a POPE, and a lot of naked woman, I highly suggest this movie!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1778793  If you are expecting a light cartoon version of Alice and Wonderland, you won't get it with this.This is one of the wierdest versions of the story I have seen yet.  It is somewhere between a dream and a nightmare.  The story flows like a dream where scenes jump from one spot to another in a sort of almost episodic flow.  This version is also a satire of the British aristocracy and culture.This was made for the BBC as a Christmas special in 1966.The soundtrack is by Ravi Shankar.  The cast is composed of some of the best known names of British comedy and theatre. Among the cast Peter Cook  plays the Mad Hatter,  Peter Sellers is the King of Hearts, But the real scene stealer is Leo McKern as the Duchess(!).All in all, this is a pretty dark version of the story. It is also one of the more \"British\".The British release also has an 8 minute silent version from 1903, director's comentary, production stills and cast bios. The American release may have more or less of these things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1778794  Obviously it's not Disney's adventures of Alice in wonderland... but I wasn't looking for it. It follows the original written story pretty well, however being that there aren't any costumes and the acting is very strangely dislocated from the characters it just feels creepy in an almost look away sort of feel.It's not that the acting is bad, but no one looks at anything in particular. They look off to the side as they speak to each other (with nearly no emotion mind you) and it is just strange.It's also apparent that the movie was prodding at social issues of the time, however I have no idea what those issues are/were so it all goes over my head untouched.An interesting look at Alice in Wonderland, however for an even stranger adaptation stop-motion version (however a bit more distant from the original) look forAliceI liked the movie, it was interesting, just lacked the fun I was hoping for in such a weird fairytale that I was not pulled in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1778799  This 1966 BBC-TV version of Lewis Carroll's classic story is, no doubt, one of the more strange and unusual versions of this tale that one is ever likely to see on film.  Filmed in black and white, and given a Victorian Gothic look; director Jonathan Miller voted against the usual presentation of talking animals and flashy visuals.  Instead, he presents a Wonderland firmly rooted in reality as seen through the distorted vision of a child's dream.  Instead of a fuzzy White Rabbit hopping hurriedly to keep his appointment, we get a fussy, hyper, and wild-eyed Victorian gentleman in white top hat and coat with bristling mutton-chop sideburns and mustache.  Also, some of Alice's dialogue is presented as a voice-over, as if we're reading her thoughts.  Alice herself rarely looks anyone in the eye and the conversations are very fractured.  Even her classic conversation with the Cheshire Cat leaves a sense of discomfort as we only see Alice, and not the Cat,during the scene.  Indeed, this Wonderland is a dark and sinister place compared to the brightly colored versions of Disney and Hallmark.For the most part, the cast of this version reads like a Who's Who of British theatre and film.  Peter Cook makes for a delightfully daft Mad Hatter, while Peter Sellers makes for a loopy King of Hearts.  Sir John Gielgud is a dignified Mock Turtle, while Sir Michael Redgrave is a wonderfully pedantic Caterpillar.  Anne-Marie Mallik is solid as a somewhat distant Alice.  Leo McKern is definitely fun to watch as he cavorts in drag as the ugly Duchess.  Ravi Shankar's score perfectly captures the mood of this dark and wonderful film.This DVD also has insightful commentary by the director, as well as an early 1906 silent film version of the story.  Overall, this is an excellent film version that captures the darker elements of Carroll's classic tale and is definitely worth your while.  However, this version might not appeal to youngsters who may be more inclined to the Disney or Hallmark versions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Video/DVD doesn't do the Rev justice.  Have to see it live.  The first 4 songs are off of the last 2 albums (Lucky 7 and Spend a Night in The Box).  Energy really doesn't pick up until Big Sky.  The last few times I've seen the Reverend, Bales of Cocaine was nowhere to be found.  Not sure if that song has been retired or what, but it is one of their better songs, and it isn't on the DVD.Just by watching these guys perform, you can see that these guys actually work for a living... and they bust their a**es doing it.The bonus stuff would probably be of interest to some of the more hardcore fans, but I don't think any newbies would get much out of it.All in all, not a bad disc.  The things that make The Rev so good live (the crowd, the sweat and the smell of cheap beer) don't really carry over to the DVD.  So, if it has been a few months since The Good Reverend has been in your town, this DVD will keep you going until the next time they come around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "1778834  Perhaps no other director could have made \"A Brief Vacation\" except for Vittorio De Sica.De Sica, who directed my favorite film of all time \"The Bicyle Thief\", is the kind of filmmkaer who is capable of projecting sincere raw emotions in his work. Whether it's \"The Bicycle Thief\", \"Two Women\" or \"Umberto D.\" De Sica's films make us care about his characters. We have a full emotional investment in what happens to them.\"A Brief Vacation\" tells the story of Clara (Florinda Bolkan) a housewife, with 3 children, who lives with her mother and brother in-law. Clara is the only one who works, since her husband was in an accident and broke his leg. But still she is expected to do for everyone and remain unappreicated. For some reason I thought of my mother while watching this movie. She too on many occasions said she never has time for herself because she's busy doing for others.As the film goes on we find out that Clara is sick, due to the unsafe enviroment of the factory she works at. In a very telling scene notice the reaction of her family as they try to convince her the doctor was trying to scare her. The doctor recommends that Clara go for a rest. If her condition does not improve she may die.Once away Clara doesn't want to leave. It's not that she doesn't care about her family, but, she has never done anything for herself, and finds that she enjoys her time alone. But reality will soon set in. And end her happiness.I suppose in a worst case scenario \"A Brief Vacation\" could have been a cliche, overly sentimental sobfest. But De Sica and Bolkan give the film a genuine feel. We accept Clara and her problems, mostly because we can relate to her situation. As I said before I thought of my mother, other may have the same experience.De Sica had died a year before this film was released in America, but remained one of the key figures in the Italian neo-realism movement. His films of course did more than simply tell a good story. Like the best films they were insights into their times. His films were a reflection of the social and political developments. Just as Rainer Werner Fassbinder made films dealing with Germany in post WW2 years so did De Sica with \"The Bicyle Thief\", \"Two Women\", and \"The Garden of the Finzi-Continis\" (during WW2).\"A Brief Vacation\" has become an obscure title. It is not available on vhs and only recently has been released on DVD. Hopefully many people will discover this De Sica masterpiece.Bottom-line: One of Vittorio De Sica's best films on par with \"The Bicyle Thief\" and \"Two Women\". Extremely involving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1778841  As you begin to view this film you realize that this piece is more of in the vein of De Sica's neo realistic work in the fifties.  The story is similar and told in the same fashion as Umberto D and Bicycle Thieves.  De Sica takes a story and follows it throw it's course without a lot of over the top melodrama or forced contrivances.  It's a quite film that explores the life of a woman trapped in a life she really isn't happy in and has no way out.  Florinda Bolkan is quite good and the supporting cast is reminiscent of the days when Italian directors used real people in their films rather than actors.  And the piece is completely believable.  The production values were excellent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1778842  This has always been one of my favorite movies, and I was overjoyed to see that it was finally available on DVD. Unfortunately over the past 30 years we have grown, and what was once cutting edge, now appears to be something that has been seen many times before.  Florinda is still beautiful and the clothing styles would fit right in today.  The return to 1973 that I was hoping for didn't happen.  A tad dissappointed, but still a great movie, and I am glad to have it in my collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1778847  Charles Dickens is an acquired taste...at times I find he tries too hard to make his characters eccentric or extreme  (either bad or good). Before the age of television, novels like his Bleak House were often too long. So what I like best in this collection is Anton Lesser's crisp, riveting narration of \"A Christmas Carol.\"  We are used to seeing Scrooge made real by actors such as Alastair Sims or George C. Scott or Albert Finney...(I won't even discuss the travesty of Jim Carrey's performance).What makes this version so different and exciting is that we encounter the well known story afresh - Anton Lesser plays the role of Charles Dickens himself and merely recites the story before a small group of friends at Christmas. But this is anything but a routine, boring recitation. For the first time, many will encounter the story just as it was written and they can use their imaginations to create a Scrooge in their own minds...or a Jacob Marley...or a Tiny Tim...or the Ghost of Christmas Present.  I really loved the performance and Anton Lesser must be congratulated for making the story alive again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1778869  The 2nd series of I'm Alan Partridge is a half a notch down from the original series. If for no other reason than that it was made second, so we are already familiar with the mans character and his unusual personality traits.That said its still a marvellously well written and performed comedy show that is sometimes very funny, and will have you cringing at Alan's antics in places. The standout episode for me is BraveAlan, where he meets a character with similar character traits. Remember the scene in the Car Park where he sees Dan and tries to shout at him to catch his attention. Dan, Dan, Dan! DAN! DAN!! Utterly brilliant.The extras are well worth seeing, but sadly there is no Steve Coogan on the commentaries, which is a real shame. The first series had Coogan and the commentaries were almost as good as the shows themselves. However the spoof TV interview/documentary is very good and some of the outtakes are worth catching.So all said and done its not quite the classic that series 1 was, but its close, and I seem to be enjoying it more each time I see it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1778878  This video was informative but it is not detailed enough for me. I'm so hungry for what I can do with my little guy that I'm buying and reading and viewing everything I can get my hands on.  I really liked Aimee Ketchum's DVD. It had SO much more information in it and she is extremely qualified and seems like a nice mommy who really cares about children. Very kind.  Her massage part is great and she gives so much information on how to interact naturally with baby to improve development that I'm so happy I found her dvd.  It's much more inexpensive than the other dvd and vhs tapes I've viewed, given the tons of information she gives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1778895  This movie is a sleeper!  Why I've never heard of it before, I have no idea.  Geraldine Page is outstanding, and the story line is poignant and wistful.  It takes us back to earlier times and joy in the simplest of traditions.  I sincerely hope some TV Channel will pick it up this year (2009).  Time to give \"It's A Wonderful Life\" a rest.My only personal disappointment was that Truman Capote narrates it.  He DOES have an annoying voice.  Still, Geraldine Page's performance more than makes up for it.I enthusiastically recommend this DVD !!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1778938  Although the film quality is not great,watching it in B&W seemed appropriate as this was how I saw it in the 60's as a child.
