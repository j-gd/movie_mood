I also did not give it five stars because it would have been nice to have the \"her ghost in the fog\" video on here, and finally I thin Dani could have done better on some parts of the songs. For example: On \"her ghost in the fog\" (live version), he chooses to growl in that typical death metal voice, instead of talking in the deep gothic voice like he does on the album. By using this growly voice, I think he is cheese'n off some of the songs best parts. Anyway, these are minor gripes and this is a must have DVD, so definitely BUY IT!...</td>\n",

In the style of Napoleon Dynamite describing a Liger, I would say \"...they're pretty much my favorite band.\"  Their music is among the worst in the industry, they suck in a way few bands can meaningfully aspire to.  I've seen them live, bought pretty much every t-shirt from every album and tour, and have almost every album that they've released over the last \"decade and a bit\".  I love it, I love it all.  I recently purchased Heavy, Left-Handed, &amp; Candid.  If you don't like Cradle of Filth, then you'll most certainly hate this DVD.  It's absolutely fantastic, full of everything I was hoping for.There is a bunch of documentary type stuff, eleven live performances, a couple of music videos, and a few other \"shorts\" put together by the band.  Another one of the bonus items they threw on the disc is a short movie called \"The Blair Twit Project\".  This is basically footage of the band walking through woodland, filmed entirely using the night-vision mode on a video camera as they follow the trail of \"a pissed northern bastard.\"  Being a \"northerner\" myself, it felt very much like a standard night walking home from the pub on a Friday night being idiots.  It's funny to watch *once*.The DVD is actually really well put together and there is a ton of material included, which is a refreshing change when compared to some other music DVDs I've bought that barely even take the time to put a decent menu together.  As with their music, most people will hate this DVD.  I loved it, but then again, I'm weird.  The live performances are pretty awesome and it has solidified my decision to have to see this band again soon.  I don't know if they come to the US very often if at all, but some guy in Hot Topic assured me that he'd seen them here a few years ago.  I'll have to keep my eyes on the tour dates.  Then the hardest job will be convincing anyone to actually go with me.  My wife say's she's up for it, but I think that will have to be seen to be believed.</td>\n",

His character is so complex, and there's so many things that I pick up on in his performance when I rewatch this movie.  I didn't really know how to fit these thoughts into my review, so I thought I would just point it out right away.  That quote above is classic rambling from Lau Ching Wan's character.  I don't know how I didn't get annoyed of his character, but Lau Ching Wan just gives such a great performance.  I kept wanting to hear what he had to say, because the more he rambles on, the more violent he gets with his words.  Great stuff.Lau Ching Wan stars as a gangster who just got out of jail, and right away he gets into a fight.  After his brawl he decides to stay at a really cheap inn run by a poor widow played by Ruby Wong.  They slowly begin a relationship, and I found it well done and touching.  Lau Ching Wan's character is over the top with how rude he is, but he does a great job at it.  I really found myself liking his character, even though his character is supposed to be almost completely unlikeable.  One scene I liked was when Lau Ching Wan literally forces the owner of the inn and her son to go out and have a day of fun with him.  It is quite an odd scene.  So they go out for the day, and do all types of fun things.  For instance Lau Ching Wan shows them what part of a wall he painted while he was in prison. But seriously, there are a lot of good things about this movie.  There's one hilarious scene where Lau throws a big fit screaming at the inn owner that his room has been taken.  He couldn't have been a bigger baby.  She doesn't say a word, politely shows him to his room, and when the door opens, the drunken Lau Ching Wan figures out after a few seconds that he must have been in the wrong room before.  Such a great scene.  There's some more scenes like that, and that's the main reason the movie is worth watching.  Plus you have those great small touches that Johnnie To is known for.  Like when the inn owner is cleaning Lau's room, she sees a big pile of money in his drawer, and she shuts the drawer right away.  Good scene with good character development for both actors.  But then what Johnnie To does is expand on it.  About 4 days pass, and she is cleaning his room, and once again sees his drawer open, but this time that big pile of money is nothing but a few bills.  Like I said, it's just a small touch.While this movie isn't that exciting, and it's anything but original, I loved the directing job, the acting, dialogue,  the short action scenes, and I found myself laughing outloud at least a few times.  Lau Ching Wan + Johnnie To.  How can you go wrong with that?  You can't.  And you also have Lam Suet giving a great performance.  This is back when he actually got good roles.  Nowadays it seems like he just gets really small roles or cameos in Johnnie To movies.  Don't expect a great thriller or something really exciting, just an enjoyable movie.Rating- 4/5The subtitles on the Universe DVD are well written, but they go by a bit too fast most of the time.  Sound is good.  5.1 and 3.0 Cantonese and Mandarin tracks.  And the picture quality isn't exactly HD, but still very good.</td>\n",

He is assured that it does have something to do with Chinatown in San Francisco and that is as close as you need to get to the Orient.

She's more of a solid, consistent performer than a blow-you-away performer, but that's hardly a bad thing.  She comes alive onstage and brings a warmth and joy to her performances that her best records can only hint at.  (Not that she doesn't make consistently records--she does.)This 1995 performance tape (and you have to keep in mind that it was originally VHS) captures her and her band at their best.  Yes, the sound could be better, but even in an actual performance setting, you might find yourself complaining about the acoustics a bit.  If the performance is solid, you can begin to overlook a few sound problems. So too with this DVD.Guests like Jackson Browne, Ruth Brown and Charles Brown and even some non-Brown(e)s like Kim Wilson and Bryan Adams add to the special event quality of the performance. And Bruce Hornsby adds his distinctive piano to a couple of numbers.  (\"I Can't Make You Love Me\" is particularly affecting.) But my favorite numbers are those featuring  Bonnie and her great band.  The chemistry between them is palpable.She ain't no amoeba.</td>\n",

A lot of the time the music and film are out of sync, but what is worse is that more than once shots belonging to an other part of the concert are used to fill up gaps elsewhere. I cannot believe that the editor actually thinks that the viewer is stupid enough to fall for these cheap solutions. The mistakes are often so obvious!

We want to see that that drummer is actually playing that particular part of the music that is coming from our speakers at that particular moment.Still, as I said, the concert is great, and the DVD is worth 4 stars; a must have for all her fans.</td>\n",

What a musical performance!  And this woman who commented on the bare-chested guys in the audience (what audacity!).  I have to be honest--haven't followed every recording of her career.  But everytime I hear her I'm floored.  Here's a woman who can belt out a ballad, play the blues, and put the most loving touch on a folk song, to bring you to tears.  Versatility is Raitt.  You want proof!?  Just see her on the Stevie Ray Vaughan tribute belting out &amp;quot;Pride and Joy.&amp;quot;  She takes a guy song and makes it into the quintessential girl's torch song!  All I can say is she made a lot of guys lonely (including me!) when she mentions a husband in the concert.  But hey, we are happy for you Bonnie.But what a minute!  The production on this video just doesn't do Bonnie justice.  I've heard much about the audio problems, and I agree.  But the video doesn't give us fans a chance!  I want something more than 5 seconds of a sustained shot on Bonnie and her guitar.  The music is there, but a bit more of Bonnie, without endless cuts to her band, would be desirable.  (A great band mind you, but nonetheless it couldn't hurt to let us see her a bit more!)I would love to see Bonnie in a proper DVD.  How about it Bonnie!  There're plenty of us out here that would love to hear from you.  You are a legend now, like BB and Buddy.  Put your music on record (in resplendent DVD)!  I'll be waiting.</td>\n",

We just get snippets of great songs and rare concert footage, and there isn't any interviews or commentary with the rest of the band (save for Linda's posthumous comments) especially from loyal, talented, long-suffering Denny Laine who was there from start to finish.

I suspect McCartney and his daughter intended to make a documentary about Wings but ended up with one about Paul and Linda instead.  But that's okay, although they should have changed the name of the DVD.The best feature of Wingspan is that Paul, for once, is remarkably articulate in the interview sections.  The questions are more intimate than you might expect from his own daughter, too.  It can't have been easy for him to talk with her about such issues as the drug bust in Japan - but he does it, apparently quite honestly.  I also loved the early films and stories of the retreat in Scotland immediately before and after the Beatles broke up, and the first Wings tour.  The shots of the 1976 American tour are also terrific - if there's enough footage of those shows for a full-length DVD, everyone who sees this will want to buy it.  Just sayin', guys.  While most fans will already know some of the stories he tells, there are several here that I've never heard before, notably the origin of \"Mrs. Vanderbilt\" and the reggae bridge in \"Live and Let Die.\"  I also came away with a lot more respect for Linda after watching this, even if the fact remains that she couldn't sing.What's not so good is the discussion of the other members of Wings and the band's work as a whole - which, after all, is apparently what the show was supposed to be about in the first place.  With occasional exceptions, the talk about the songs is fairly cursory, and this is even more true when it comes to the musicians.  Denny Laine, the only constant member of Wings besides Paul and Linda (and, on two occasions, the only other member of the band) doesn't get anywhere near the screen time he warrants.  Some of the other members literally only get one mention in passing.  Then again, that is an accurate reflection of how long they were in the group!  Their best-selling album, \"Wings at the Speed of Sound,\" isn't discussed at all and only about a minute's worth of it is even used as background music.  (I can't help wondering if this is Paul and Mary's way of acknowledging that, big as it was, it's not a very good album.)  During the segment on the 1976 tour, he recites a rather obnoxious nursery rhyme he made up in response to questions about a Beatles reunion - without ever mentioning that Ringo turned up at one of the shows and he seemed quite happy about it at the time.  I'd love to know why he left that out.Overall, the good outweighs the bad.  Now, let's see about a full-length Wings concert DVD...</td>\n",

       "      <td>For this \"rockumentary,\" Paul McCartney is interviewed by his daughter. He is very playful and relaxed, given his familiarity with the interviewer. At the beginning of the program we witness the dissolution of the Beatles and the marriage of Paul and Linda. Interestingly, none of the other Beatles were in attendance at the hastily arranged nuptials. Later, Paul wonders if he can make it as a solo artist. After releasing a couple of solo albums, he decides to form a new band. His wife Linda would be a member of the group, even though she had little musical experience. Paul admired Denny Laine's guitar playing and singing with the Moody Blues.  Denny was asked to join his new group Wings. As it turned out, Denny Laine was the ONLY member of Wings to stay with the group from start to finish, other than Linda. However, his musical contributions - what songs he wrote and sang on, or contributed a guitar solo to - are never discussed. Mr. Laine was not interviewed for this DVD, nor are any clips of old interviews with him included. Other band members are only mentioned in passing although, to be fair, most only lasted with Wings a short time.As Paul said near the end of the program, he proved that he could have major hits and successful world tours with another band after the Beatles. After Paul's infamous drug bust in Japan, he felt that it was time to give everything a rest. Thus Wings ended, not with a bang but with a whimper. Surprisingly, there is no booklet or even an insert included with the DVD. The extras include complete live performances of two songs - \"Jet\" and \"Let 'Em In\" - as well as the studio session for the instrumental \"Rockestra.\" The discography contains mistakes; when you click on the song list for \"Wings Over America\" it displays the song list for \"Wings At The Speed Of Sound.\" A little more attention to detail and interviews with other band members could easily have made this a 5 star DVD.</td>\n",

Some of the animation is a little choppy in parts, but that might have been intended.  The animation styles change throughout the movie giving it a strange but effective painterly feel.  A large team of animators worked on this film, understandibly, and that is part of the appeal, if you don't like what is being said, or the annimation style, you can just wait five or ten minutes and another style of annimation will take over.  This is a truly original film about lucid dreams...a hot topic in the world of cinema.

It's all very interesting, and the young man is very absorbed in what they are saying, but something doesn't seem quite right about it all. He can't read his clock, for instance. He's wearing a watch that he hasn't had since fourth grade. Lights don't work when he flicks them. Could he be in a dream? If he is, what is the nature of this dream? What is its purpose? Where is it taking him? Most importantly, can he wake from it?The animation is hard to describe, which is a compliment really. In terms of motion, very often its realistic. As for shape, perspective, colors, facial experessions and such, you're only really shown a vague impression of what's there. There's also a bit of weirdness thrown in for good measure too (if someone is talking about something, for instance, the image of that something might float off in the background).I have mixed feelings about the dialogue.One good thing about it is that it feels real at times, I guess, not like a script. There's a lot of interesting concepts in the conversations, and its interesting to find that some people have thought the same things I have.Yeah, there's a lot to consider, if you can make it through all the pretentiousness. It was conversations and pretense like this that put me off going to do arts at a college. I could not live in an environment where people talk like this, and pursue such silly things under the guise of signficance. It all can be said and felt so much simpler, honestly. I mean, I can appreciate the personalities of the characters in this film. The Irish-American guy who goes on about neo-humans and the new paradigm of evolution, for instance. For all his big words and \"significant\" ideas, all he really wants is a world where people can be themselves. When he gets to that point, he uses the simplest phrase to describe how he feels about it: \"it would be nice\". Perhaps that's why he was drawn to the ideas he was discussing, maybe he could figure out a way that people can be themselves if he could create a way in his head. Perhaps the teachings he was brought up with were supposed to work, but didn't do it for him, so he got caught up trying to make things right mentally. If Richard Linklater had been trying to push point like that across, that people conjure up complex ideas to fill simple needs, I would have given the film five stars. The trouble is, he doesnt say that at all, he tries to make the film really significant, and to quote one of the characters: \"heavy\". Linklater probably acknowledges that there is some truth, if not agrees with, everything said in the film, as the points made throughout the dialogue appear as themes throughout the film. I reckon Linklatr believes these ideas really do apply to life, to \"Waking Life\" anyway.It's almost like an intellectual narcissim, these characters are so caught up in their ideas, tangled up in their own heads. They go on and on and on, like it's a great, significant revelation, like everyone should listen, like everyone should be heading in the direction they are in life. Reminds me of some friends, actually. I know a few mentally ill people and most of them are mighty, mighty perceptive philosophers. It kind of makes you wonder where the hardcore thinker stops and the delusional thinker begins. Too much learning makes you sick, like old King Solomon of Israel used to say, that's what I reckon.There's a couple of \"shocking\" moments which I thought were in a bit of bad taste. A guy, yearning to be heard by the world, pours petrol all over himself, asks Wiley Wiggins' character for a match, then sets himself on fire, for instance. The music, however was in better taste. Kind of reminded me of the way George Martin set up the string section for Beatles songs in terms of production (think Eleanor Rigby), bit artier arrangements than Martin would do though.For a little bit I dabbled in lucid dreaming, which is discussed a little in this film. My experience is a little different from the one in this film. It's true you don't have much control with light switches, but rather than staying all on or all off, I found they'd turn on, but then kind of dim a bit, like something was sapping the power somewhere else. Also, when I did actually have control of my dreams, the stuff I wanted to do just whizzed by so fast, rather than happening normally. I remember I wanted to change the color of my skin, and I went through every color I could remember in what I perceived to be seconds, the speed probably coming from the simple fact that I could make it go that fast, hyper curiousity maybe. I was really disappointed with the experience and stopped doing it. Just as well, it isn't good to muck round with that sort of thing at all.It's definitely an interesting and creative film though, and if you can handle the thick dialogue it's worth a look.</td>\n",

       "      <td>If you enjoy hearing folks wax philosophical and don't mind spacey visuals, you may enjoy this film. Here is a sample from Robert Solomon:\"The reason why I refuse to take existentialism as just another French fashion or historical curiosity is that I think it has something very important to offer us for the new century. I'm afraid we're losing the real virtues of living life passionately, in the sense of taking responsibility for who you are, the ability to make something of yourself, and feeling good about life. Existentialism is often discussed as if it's a philosophy of despair. But I think the truth is just the opposite. Sartre, once interviewed, said he never really felt a day of despair in his life. But one thing that comes out from reading these guys is not a sense of anguish about life so much as a real kind of exuberance, of feeling on top of it. Its like: your life is yours to create.\"I've read the postmodernists with some interest, even admiration. But when I read them I always have this awful nagging feeling that something absolutely essential is getting left out. The more that you talk about a person as a social construction or as a confluence of forces or as fragmented or marginalized, what you do is you open up a whole new world of excuses. And when Sartre talks about responsibility he's not talking about something abstract. He's not talking about the kind of self or soul that theologians would argue about. It's something very concrete. It's you and me talking, making decisions, doing things, and taking the consequences.\"It might be true that there are six billion people in the world and counting, nevertheless, what you do makes a difference. It makes a difference first of all in material terms. It makes a difference to other people. And it sets an example. And in short I think the message here is that we should never simply write ourselves off and see ourselves as the victim of various forces. It's always _our_ decision who we are.\"</td>\n",

The film begins with a tango that sounds like Piazzola but is apparently pure Texas - a nice surprise.  The animation is reminiscent of a more detailed (and deft) paint-by-numbers style.  Squirming strokes and flat sections of color wobble and morph from cel to cel giving a sense of depth and muscularity that is more typical of fine-art painting than contemporary animation.  There are several different animator's hands in evidence, but the multiple styles are similar and complementary.  It's worth seeing just for the look of the thing.The plot, as such, is basically Wiley Wiggins walking around trying to figure out where he is, with side trips into why he is, or who he is.  The characters he meets on this ramble are intensely ordinary yet interesting, and the whole thing has a very &amp;quot;finding ourselves&amp;quot; college-town feel.  Even the crackpots are interesting, if only for the pure spectacle of watching an inspired lunatic perform his or her best schtick.  It does drag a bit in spots, but I suspect the scenes that will seem more or less compelling will vary from viewer to viewer.  However, I particularly loved the angry guy, the lucid dream/light switch guy, and the girl with the angular face and red sausage curls.  And if you have wondered what happened to the couple from Linklater's earlier &amp;quot;Before Sunrise,&amp;quot; we do find out here - a nice little valentine.There is no action to speak of, no real conclusions - just lots and lots of talk and some really gorgeous and unique animation and a fabulous soundtrack.</td>\n",

Instead he was revisiting his memories before leaving earth, gradually letting go of his life &amp;amp; body now able to accept his death.

       "      <td>&amp;quot;Waking Life&amp;quot; completes (continues?) the walking-and-talking trilogy Richard Linklater started with &amp;quot;Slackers&amp;quot; and took up again with &amp;quot;Before Sunrise&amp;quot;.  It owes much to the form and content of those previous movies, borrowing &amp;quot;Slackers&amp;quot;s disjointed structure and &amp;quot;Before Sunrise&amp;quot;s unabashed romanticism.  Only this time it's not a romance between a man and a woman, but between one man's sleeping and waking life.For me, initially, this was a tough film to engage with.  The first third was terribly boring to sit through; at times it was a tough fight to keep my drooping eyes from closing for good.  The friend I saw it with wasn't as lucky, for I caught her napping early on (she later admitted that the nap I saw was actually her third, and this was during the film's first half hour!).  Frankly, this sleepiness should be expected, for the first &amp;quot;act&amp;quot; consists entirely of Wiley Wiggins encountering various random, verbose individuals, whom all ramble on about their great philosophical theories.  Combine the droning nature of the dialogue, the very liquid backgrounds (the animation was beautiful, true, but very hypnotic; like watching the ocean on a breezy day), and a meandering anti-narrative, and you get a sleep inducing movie.This first third was like listening to someone's long, boring dream, an observation that Linklater, appearing near the end as himself, actually cops to.  Kudos to him for admitting the inherent flaw in his movie (This flaw is also alluded to when Steven Soderbergh, in a brief cameo, tells an anecdote about how Billy Wilder described Louis Malle's upcoming $2.5 million dream-within-a-dream movie as a &amp;quot;$2.5 million loss&amp;quot;).  However, even though the film is preachy, pretentious, long-winded, and droning at times, I give Linklater credit for including such off-beat discussion in his relatively mainstream movie.The movie takes a drastic turn around halfway through, when Wiggins' character experiences dream lucidity in a &amp;quot;Holy Moment&amp;quot;.  I'll not spoil how, for it was, for me, the most exhilarating moment of the movie.  Needless to say, from this point on he is no longer a passive listener, but is allowed to engage the people he meets in thought provoking discussion. It picks up some much needed energy from this moment.  The movie changes from being a series of boring lectures (reminded me of school!) to a series of fascinating social discourses (in one of the scenes that doesn't involve Wiggins, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy seemingly revive their &amp;quot;Before Sunrise&amp;quot; roles, going so far as to quote their prior selves regarding a discussion they had in that movie about the division of the soul as the world's population increases -- it's much more fascinating than the way I describe it here, trust me).The animation is impressive and necessary for the kind of movie this is (in an interview, Linklater admitted that if live-action characters spoke his trippy dialogue, the audience would be hard-pressed to believe; the animation allows him to go off on tangents, work through absurd trains of thought, and generally make as much or as little sense as he wanted, just as a real dream would).  The visuals do take a while to get used to, though.  In the beginning I found myself noticing the technique more than paying attention to the dialogue.  If you let yourself, the minutiae that the artists include in the background can be quite engrossing.  That being said, with a new toy like this a lot more could have been done, which would have been distracting.  Linklater reins in his animators with a fine sense of restraint, not allowing them to go wild and fully exploit the animation to any extreme, but only go far enough to show a glimpse of its magnificent possibilities.  I was grateful for this.&amp;quot;Waking Life&amp;quot; is a unique movie-going experience, at least for me.  I left the theatre confused, disoriented, and mildly disappointed.  It is only after 12 hours of reflection that I realize the particular genius here.  I can't stop thinking about what it all means, and am truly glad that I saw the film.</td>\n",

First of all, it's visually impressive (though not absolutely mind-blowing as some have said...if you've seen a lot of animation, you've probably seen plenty of stuff this inventive), making some of the best use of rotoscoping (animated tracing over live-action figures, with animated backgrounds) that I've seen in a feature; it's got a fairly ambitious intellectual conceit (a man who may or may not be on the verge of death throughout the film dreams in a lucid way about what the nature of reality, consciousness, free will, etc really are); it's got great music (by Glover Gill)...what more could you want? Well, for starters, it works out to be not much more than philosophical ramblings, and I think to some extent it wears out its welcome. Now, if you knew me you'd know I often like long movies...I have no problem with a lot of work that a lot of people call \"slow\"; but this was to me too much of the same thing. And some of the observations are facile in a druggy-stoner way that just made me think, who cares?  Like pothead versions of Seinfeld and company, frankly.Still, adding it up, I'm thinking about it quite a lot since I first watched the excellent, feature-packed DVD a couple of years ago. Another aspect I really liked was the self-referentiality: the film as a whole is very reminiscent of the director's first feature, SLACKER; it contains a short scene with Jesse and Celine, the characters from the previous BEFORE SUNRISE that also obviously looks forward to the sequel to that film, BEFORE SUNSET; the technique used and some of the more fantastic imagery seems now a tryout for the director's later rotoscoped Philip K Dick adaptation, A SCANNER DARKLY; and both Linklater and his good friend (and fellow experimental-at-times filmmaker) Steven Soderbergh make appearances. And there's a scene or two late in the film that is reminiscent of the work of another extremely self-referential artist, the experimental American SF writer Samuel R. Delany (specificially, his 1000-page, Joycean \"Dhalgren\").I need to see it again; reading some pretty intelligent reviews this afternoon leads me to believe that a deeper reading would be more rewarding. Despite many reservations, I'm giving it high marks simply for attempting subject matter and film techniques that nobody else in America seems interested in. Linklater has proved himself a great disciple of European art cinema, not just the usual Scorsese-Coppola-DePalma stuff, and that's all to the good.</td>\n",

I'll concede that a large amount of time is devoted to just such activity, but I posit that Waking Life also functions as a Zen adventure story and a rather wry comedy (with humor ranging from black to cute).I took my sister and her BF to see this one at the Capitol (OFS) Theater (Olympia's arthaus of champions), expecting (as various reviews had portrayed the movie) something pretty, largely incoherent, and pretentious enough to provide plenty of unintentional fun. But WL actually posesses both plot and structure, and although some of the individual encounters the main character is involved in carry something of a pretentious air, the overall story is simple, well-integrated into the disjointed structure dictated by the overarching theme of dreaming, and (I thought) rather beautiful.Similarly, the wry humor of the movie should be mentioned in any review of WL. Many of the chuckles are character-based, like the 'go-for-broke' beer salute of the biker/dreamwalker, or the riotous cynicism of the gas-station attendent (neither my sister nor I can even think about microwavable burritos anymore without remembering his story about the vision-quester), but the occasional gonzo visual jest or uncomfortable giggle are sure to make their appearance.Finally, I'd like to say that the Phil 101 course-supplement material should be neither overvalued nor undervalued. In response to those who praise WL as the most! significant! movie! ever!, I'd like to remind that nothing particularly new is presented here, and that enlightenment-seekers would be better off hitting the shelves. To those who write it all off as simply pretentious wankery, I argue that it actually serves a purpose within the spare narrative that the movie is based around, and that although none of it is intended to be accepted at face value by the audience, contemplating the steady flow of 'ideas on feet' can have an overall mind-opening effect that helps us to identify with the drifting main character.Anyhow, I was thoroughly entertained by this movie while watching it, and it left me with a fair amount to talk about afterwards (including the topic of lucid dreaming, which can be a rewarding investigation). Not only that, but it's very much unlike anything else I've seen recently, which makes it a nice palate-cleanser for the entertainment taste buds. 4 stars, and I'm buying it when it hits DVD.</td>\n",

I was disappointed that they were left floating while the more cliched philosophical revelations took precedence. The most telling moment of the film included a tortured novelist in - what else? - a dark cafe.Every character presented himself as an expert, so telling apart the wise from the banal was an interesting exercise.I did love the animation, however.

       "0     This video actually focuses mostly on one of the characters that Emmanuelle (Krista Allen) is trying to teach about sex & love. It's still pretty entertaining but if you are mostly interested in Kirsta Allen then you should know that she's not really in much of this episode.

       "1     This episode pretty much has Hafron and Emmanuelle teleporting to different parts of the world and &quot;doing it&quot;. There is the continuing plot from an earlier episode of some group on Earth trying to track them down. That's the main reason for Emmanuelle and Hafron to jump to different parts of the world. Otherwise, this episode is mostly sex scenes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2     This is an intimate concert of Robert Mirabal.  Although I thought that it was, as I said, masterful, the sound, at times sounded a little muffled.The storytelling of the songs gave an insight of native culture and of Mirabal's own family stories and history.The Dance and Ee You Oo are my picks for the best songs, but they are all a joy to watch.  The Rare Tribal Mob and the Mirabal Singers/Dancers are great and provide a mesmerising stage performance.Very enjoyable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "4     Great show from the inventors of the extreme gothic metal genre !! 75'of pure mayhem with good visuals and a great sound, although the vocals are a little high in the mix for my taste and the guitar on the right channel is 10 times louder than the one on the left so I ended up switching it to mono to even things up. It's hard to give this more stars esp. when you've watched the PTSFirepower DVD first like I did, that one is so much better. The 5 bonus videoclips totally rule and round up the package making the purchase a worthy one.Now the mockumentary may not be suited to everyone's tastes, personally it bored me and know of a lot of people who feels it ruins the band's image. Well don't watch it then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "5     I rented this dvd, i didnt buy it.  I also rented PanDamonAeon and Mannequin.  This dvd has excellent very long concert footage.  Its practically the same songs as on Livebait for the Dead.  And then we have the rest of the dvd.  Im sorry, i love CoF but that \"schockumentary\" thing was just sad.  I could barely stand to watch it.  It's stupid and boring, maybe if theyd shown more of the band in a more coherent manner...and it just goes on and on forever.  This is a 2 hour plus dvd adn half of it is crap.  The \"blair twit Project\" is slightly amusing, but mostly boring.  The music videos are good though.  I would still recommend buying this dvd just for the music videos and the concert footage.  PanDamonAeon gave me more joy though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "6     Excellent Sound, Excellent Picture, Tons and Tons of songs. Love the Scorched Earth Erotic video. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't think they let their female singer sing enough, it adds a nice goth touch. I also did not give it five stars because it would have been nice to have the \"her ghost in the fog\" video on here, and finally I thin Dani could have done better on some parts of the songs. For example: On \"her ghost in the fog\" (live version), he chooses to growl in that typical death metal voice, instead of talking in the deep gothic voice like he does on the album. By using this growly voice, I think he is cheese'n off some of the songs best parts. Anyway, these are minor gripes and this is a must have DVD, so definitely BUY IT!...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "7     As most of my friends hate, I'm massively into Cradle of Filth.  In the style of Napoleon Dynamite describing a Liger, I would say \"...they're pretty much my favorite band.\"  Their music is among the worst in the industry, they suck in a way few bands can meaningfully aspire to.  I've seen them live, bought pretty much every t-shirt from every album and tour, and have almost every album that they've released over the last \"decade and a bit\".  I love it, I love it all.  I recently purchased Heavy, Left-Handed, & Candid.  If you don't like Cradle of Filth, then you'll most certainly hate this DVD.  It's absolutely fantastic, full of everything I was hoping for.There is a bunch of documentary type stuff, eleven live performances, a couple of music videos, and a few other \"shorts\" put together by the band.  Another one of the bonus items they threw on the disc is a short movie called \"The Blair Twit Project\".  This is basically footage of the band walking through woodland, filmed entirely using the night-vision mode on a video camera as they follow the trail of \"a pissed northern bastard.\"  Being a \"northerner\" myself, it felt very much like a standard night walking home from the pub on a Friday night being idiots.  It's funny to watch *once*.The DVD is actually really well put together and there is a ton of material included, which is a refreshing change when compared to some other music DVDs I've bought that barely even take the time to put a decent menu together.  As with their music, most people will hate this DVD.  I loved it, but then again, I'm weird.  The live performances are pretty awesome and it has solidified my decision to have to see this band again soon.  I don't know if they come to the US very often if at all, but some guy in Hot Topic assured me that he'd seen them here a few years ago.  I'll have to keep my eyes on the tour dates.  Then the hardest job will be convincing anyone to actually go with me.  My wife say's she's up for it, but I think that will have to be seen to be believed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "8     This category 3 classic mixes genres like only Hong Kong use to be able to do before the takeover. It over priced because of it's rarity so unless you collect rare Category 3 films you might want to get something else. As Category 3 films go this is entertaining but not as over the top as Dr. lamb, Red to Kill or the Untold Story.

       "12    Wow, I thought I rambled, but Lau Ching wan takes it to another level!  His character is so complex, and there's so many things that I pick up on in his performance when I rewatch this movie.  I didn't really know how to fit these thoughts into my review, so I thought I would just point it out right away.  That quote above is classic rambling from Lau Ching Wan's character.  I don't know how I didn't get annoyed of his character, but Lau Ching Wan just gives such a great performance.  I kept wanting to hear what he had to say, because the more he rambles on, the more violent he gets with his words.  Great stuff.Lau Ching Wan stars as a gangster who just got out of jail, and right away he gets into a fight.  After his brawl he decides to stay at a really cheap inn run by a poor widow played by Ruby Wong.  They slowly begin a relationship, and I found it well done and touching.  Lau Ching Wan's character is over the top with how rude he is, but he does a great job at it.  I really found myself liking his character, even though his character is supposed to be almost completely unlikeable.  One scene I liked was when Lau Ching Wan literally forces the owner of the inn and her son to go out and have a day of fun with him.  It is quite an odd scene.  So they go out for the day, and do all types of fun things.  For instance Lau Ching Wan shows them what part of a wall he painted while he was in prison. But seriously, there are a lot of good things about this movie.  There's one hilarious scene where Lau throws a big fit screaming at the inn owner that his room has been taken.  He couldn't have been a bigger baby.  She doesn't say a word, politely shows him to his room, and when the door opens, the drunken Lau Ching Wan figures out after a few seconds that he must have been in the wrong room before.  Such a great scene.  There's some more scenes like that, and that's the main reason the movie is worth watching.  Plus you have those great small touches that Johnnie To is known for.  Like when the inn owner is cleaning Lau's room, she sees a big pile of money in his drawer, and she shuts the drawer right away.  Good scene with good character development for both actors.  But then what Johnnie To does is expand on it.  About 4 days pass, and she is cleaning his room, and once again sees his drawer open, but this time that big pile of money is nothing but a few bills.  Like I said, it's just a small touch.While this movie isn't that exciting, and it's anything but original, I loved the directing job, the acting, dialogue,  the short action scenes, and I found myself laughing outloud at least a few times.  Lau Ching Wan + Johnnie To.  How can you go wrong with that?  You can't.  And you also have Lam Suet giving a great performance.  This is back when he actually got good roles.  Nowadays it seems like he just gets really small roles or cameos in Johnnie To movies.  Don't expect a great thriller or something really exciting, just an enjoyable movie.Rating- 4/5The subtitles on the Universe DVD are well written, but they go by a bit too fast most of the time.  Sound is good.  5.1 and 3.0 Cantonese and Mandarin tracks.  And the picture quality isn't exactly HD, but still very good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "13    Killer is an okay HK film with a familiar storyline.  Jordan Chan is a well respected hitman who wants to go into legit businesses with his crooked homies.  However, he's trapped in the game and his world is starting to fall apart.  The performances are good and I really cared about the main characters.  Sexy Yoyo Mung is always a treat for my eyes and I was really surprised and thrilled to see Shaw Brothers veteran, Lo Meng as a rival mob boss.  I just wish there was a little more action.  Director Billy Chung should have asked Johnnie To for a few pointers.  With more action scenes and a better ending, this really could have been a Killer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "14    Loved it, terrible movie at it's core, but very appealing visually.  Shot well, funny, and slick.  As a fan of the horror genre (I'm of the Halloween and Friday the 13th generation) I'm used to seeing the girls in bikini/underwear/nothing for eyecandy.  This one finally gives the boys a turn, with the male lead jogging shirtless, bending and stretching in long camera shots, and showing off his nice assets.  The head vampire, who obviously adores him, is a hottie as well, and loves to hang out in his underwear with all his friends.

       "15    Don't waste any time thinking where is the horror in that flick, fellas.The story of that low, 'low' budget movie is an excuse for delivering underwear homoerotic scenes of some of the most hot young males that the director could find when it shooted the movie.So, if you like any of this like i do, apart from expend a very entertaining corny one and a half hour of your life, there's a great chance that you really enjoy it.Personally, as an horror movies fan, i think that it's time to center the erotic interest of that movies in the males, after passing more than twenty years worshiping the body of women.Apparently, there's a lot of people agreeing with me. As an example, take a look at THE COVENANT, one major studio horror flick that is nothing more that a David Decoteau movie, but with a real 'budget' attached to itAfter all, yes; the movie is cheap. But the dvd's also.If you like it, don't miss from the same director: THE BROTHERHOOD: YOUNG WARLOCKS, SPEED DEMON, LEECHES, VOODOO ACADEMY AND BEASTLY BOYZ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "18    Based on Hugh Wiley's inscrutable Oriental detective Mr. Wong, Boris Karloff is called upon by his detective friend to solve the murder of undercover detective Dan O'Grady that includes smuggling. James Lee Wong informs Capt. Bill Street (Grant Withers) that he can only help if it has something to do with the Orient.

       "22    I always make a point to see Bonnie Raitt live whenever I can. I've caught her in all kinds of venues and she's never disappointed.  She's more of a solid, consistent performer than a blow-you-away performer, but that's hardly a bad thing.  She comes alive onstage and brings a warmth and joy to her performances that her best records can only hint at.  (Not that she doesn't make consistently records--she does.)This 1995 performance tape (and you have to keep in mind that it was originally VHS) captures her and her band at their best.  Yes, the sound could be better, but even in an actual performance setting, you might find yourself complaining about the acoustics a bit.  If the performance is solid, you can begin to overlook a few sound problems. So too with this DVD.Guests like Jackson Browne, Ruth Brown and Charles Brown and even some non-Brown(e)s like Kim Wilson and Bryan Adams add to the special event quality of the performance. And Bruce Hornsby adds his distinctive piano to a couple of numbers.  (\"I Can't Make You Love Me\" is particularly affecting.) But my favorite numbers are those featuring  Bonnie and her great band.  The chemistry between them is palpable.She ain't no amoeba.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "23    Bonnie is one of my all time favorite artists. I was blown away by the Road Tested CD a few years ago and expected a lot from the DVD. The music, the sound, the stage, the lighting, the registration, the colors are all great indeed, but the editing is all wrong and annoying. A lot of the time the music and film are out of sync, but what is worse is that more than once shots belonging to an other part of the concert are used to fill up gaps elsewhere. I cannot believe that the editor actually thinks that the viewer is stupid enough to fall for these cheap solutions. The mistakes are often so obvious! It is not enough to show, let's say, a drummer who is drumming. NO! We want to see that that drummer is actually playing that particular part of the music that is coming from our speakers at that particular moment.Still, as I said, the concert is great, and the DVD is worth 4 stars; a must have for all her fans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "24    This re-issue of the 1995 classic VHS concerttape/CD should have been  right up there withthe best sound quality you could possible get, but,for some reason it didn't quite rate the very

       "26    Let me start with a few words about Bonnie Raitt.  I first saw her at the Lenox Arts Center in MA in the early '70s, and it is one of those performances that sticks with you.  What a musical performance!  And this woman who commented on the bare-chested guys in the audience (what audacity!).  I have to be honest--haven't followed every recording of her career.  But everytime I hear her I'm floored.  Here's a woman who can belt out a ballad, play the blues, and put the most loving touch on a folk song, to bring you to tears.  Versatility is Raitt.  You want proof!?  Just see her on the Stevie Ray Vaughan tribute belting out &quot;Pride and Joy.&quot;  She takes a guy song and makes it into the quintessential girl's torch song!  All I can say is she made a lot of guys lonely (including me!) when she mentions a husband in the concert.  But hey, we are happy for you Bonnie.But what a minute!  The production on this video just doesn't do Bonnie justice.  I've heard much about the audio problems, and I agree.  But the video doesn't give us fans a chance!  I want something more than 5 seconds of a sustained shot on Bonnie and her guitar.  The music is there, but a bit more of Bonnie, without endless cuts to her band, would be desirable.  (A great band mind you, but nonetheless it couldn't hurt to let us see her a bit more!)I would love to see Bonnie in a proper DVD.  How about it Bonnie!  There're plenty of us out here that would love to hear from you.  You are a legend now, like BB and Buddy.  Put your music on record (in resplendent DVD)!  I'll be waiting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "27    In intimate conversation with daughter Mary (whose husband directed), Paul McCartney discusses life after the Beatles, and how his next challenge was to form a band, pack up the family, and hit the road.  88 minute film seen on ABC-TV is satisfying for fans but footage shown could have been expanded.  We just get snippets of great songs and rare concert footage, and there isn't any interviews or commentary with the rest of the band (save for Linda's posthumous comments) especially from loyal, talented, long-suffering Denny Laine who was there from start to finish.  DVD extras include an additional 22 minute discussion between Paul and Mary, promotional videos for &quot;Jet&quot; and &quot;Let 'Em In&quot; (which were both taken from the &quot;Rockshow&quot; film) and the superstar jam &quot;Rockestra&quot;.  Just three videos?  Also included is a discography and a photo gallery, with 100 pictures.  A neat package, but they should have alloted themselves more than 88 minutes to cover a nine-year career, especially with all the great music involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "28    The worst thing I can say about Wingspan is that the title is misleading.  I suspect McCartney and his daughter intended to make a documentary about Wings but ended up with one about Paul and Linda instead.  But that's okay, although they should have changed the name of the DVD.The best feature of Wingspan is that Paul, for once, is remarkably articulate in the interview sections.  The questions are more intimate than you might expect from his own daughter, too.  It can't have been easy for him to talk with her about such issues as the drug bust in Japan - but he does it, apparently quite honestly.  I also loved the early films and stories of the retreat in Scotland immediately before and after the Beatles broke up, and the first Wings tour.  The shots of the 1976 American tour are also terrific - if there's enough footage of those shows for a full-length DVD, everyone who sees this will want to buy it.  Just sayin', guys.  While most fans will already know some of the stories he tells, there are several here that I've never heard before, notably the origin of \"Mrs. Vanderbilt\" and the reggae bridge in \"Live and Let Die.\"  I also came away with a lot more respect for Linda after watching this, even if the fact remains that she couldn't sing.What's not so good is the discussion of the other members of Wings and the band's work as a whole - which, after all, is apparently what the show was supposed to be about in the first place.  With occasional exceptions, the talk about the songs is fairly cursory, and this is even more true when it comes to the musicians.  Denny Laine, the only constant member of Wings besides Paul and Linda (and, on two occasions, the only other member of the band) doesn't get anywhere near the screen time he warrants.  Some of the other members literally only get one mention in passing.  Then again, that is an accurate reflection of how long they were in the group!  Their best-selling album, \"Wings at the Speed of Sound,\" isn't discussed at all and only about a minute's worth of it is even used as background music.  (I can't help wondering if this is Paul and Mary's way of acknowledging that, big as it was, it's not a very good album.)  During the segment on the 1976 tour, he recites a rather obnoxious nursery rhyme he made up in response to questions about a Beatles reunion - without ever mentioning that Ringo turned up at one of the shows and he seemed quite happy about it at the time.  I'd love to know why he left that out.Overall, the good outweighs the bad.  Now, let's see about a full-length Wings concert DVD...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "29    For this \"rockumentary,\" Paul McCartney is interviewed by his daughter. He is very playful and relaxed, given his familiarity with the interviewer. At the beginning of the program we witness the dissolution of the Beatles and the marriage of Paul and Linda. Interestingly, none of the other Beatles were in attendance at the hastily arranged nuptials. Later, Paul wonders if he can make it as a solo artist. After releasing a couple of solo albums, he decides to form a new band. His wife Linda would be a member of the group, even though she had little musical experience. Paul admired Denny Laine's guitar playing and singing with the Moody Blues.  Denny was asked to join his new group Wings. As it turned out, Denny Laine was the ONLY member of Wings to stay with the group from start to finish, other than Linda. However, his musical contributions - what songs he wrote and sang on, or contributed a guitar solo to - are never discussed. Mr. Laine was not interviewed for this DVD, nor are any clips of old interviews with him included. Other band members are only mentioned in passing although, to be fair, most only lasted with Wings a short time.As Paul said near the end of the program, he proved that he could have major hits and successful world tours with another band after the Beatles. After Paul's infamous drug bust in Japan, he felt that it was time to give everything a rest. Thus Wings ended, not with a bang but with a whimper. Surprisingly, there is no booklet or even an insert included with the DVD. The extras include complete live performances of two songs - \"Jet\" and \"Let 'Em In\" - as well as the studio session for the instrumental \"Rockestra.\" The discography contains mistakes; when you click on the song list for \"Wings Over America\" it displays the song list for \"Wings At The Speed Of Sound.\" A little more attention to detail and interviews with other band members could easily have made this a 5 star DVD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "5730  Waking Life is the kind of movie that you will see and then spend days afterwards contemplating what you have seen and heard.  Not only is it a visual masterpiece, but the dialogue is incredibly deep and thought provoking.  At first it was all a little too much to take in at once, with the crazy animation and the abundance of philisophical debate, but after about 30 minutes I really started to get into it.  I can't wait to get the DVD so I can listen to the discussions all over again.  This is truly a unique film in the best sense of the word.  I highly recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

There were several animators working on the film, each working on a different scene, which made it more interesting.  One or two of the animation styles, however, were simplistic to the point that they \"pulled me out\" of the movie.  Fans of more \"traditional\" Western or Japanese animation, or of comic books, might like Linklater's latest film, A Scanner Darkly, a bit more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "5733  This is without any reservation what so ever, the most thought provoking film I have ever seen.  This rotoscoped anamated story is about a young moving through a dream and learning much along the way.  It is not (as a generalization), a film that a strictly action fan might enjoy, but because of the captivating animation and insightful dialogue.  If you liked &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; or thought that the best thing about Tarantino's movies were the dialogue, then you might really get a kick out of &quot;Waking Life.&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "5734  The movie was interesting in relating life and existence, common understanding and accepted ideas, and that was the primary focus of it.  I enjoyed the notions that were shared in it, but it was generally without much of a plot, more a string of thoughts.  I would enjoy to watch it for the mind-expansion, but it can wear you down in a dark movie theater.  I had to go after about an hour of watching it.  I can sleep at home.  But I will be watching it again, possibly with a purchase in the equation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "5737  An insightful look into the abstract human mind.  The movie basically consists of the main character moving throughout a dream, discussing theories of all of life's complexities and mysteries with random people.  This is not a movie for the narrow-minded, thinking outside the box is a prerequisite for enjoying this movie.In addition to heavy abstract intellectual themes, the visual technique, called rotoscoping, creates a dreamlike, \"other worldly\" feel to the movie.The only reason it doesn't get five stars is that it is slightly difficult to follow in the beginning, though it does get progressively easier. Highly recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "5738  Trippy and incisive or visually irritating and pretentious? Half-empty or half-full? Richard Linklater's unique rotoscoped treatise on the Meaning Of Life seems to polarize its reviewers like night and day. If you like neat little tied-up Hollywood endings prefaced by  neon signs flashing plot points along the way, you are likely to find this one a snoozefest. If you go into this one with an open mind and an objective philosophical stance, you'll find it at least mildly engaging, and never boring. The fact that the film suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder is what makes it most interesting to this reviewer. Try this at home: Pop this film in the player while you're watching your favorite commercial TV program. During the spot breaks, instead of hitting 'mute' or surfing channels, watch &quot;Waking Life&quot; in 3 to 5 minute serialized segments. It all suddenly makes much more sense, doesn't it?

       "5740  The first half of the movie is like being trapped in a college coffee house discussion of philosphy.  Ideas that we have all heard before ranted on and on.  Interesting at first but after an hour I was gettins somewhat annoyed, luckily the animation is enough to keep you entertained.  Some of the animation is a little choppy in parts, but that might have been intended.  The animation styles change throughout the movie giving it a strange but effective painterly feel.  A large team of animators worked on this film, understandibly, and that is part of the appeal, if you don't like what is being said, or the annimation style, you can just wait five or ten minutes and another style of annimation will take over.  This is a truly original film about lucid dreams...a hot topic in the world of cinema.  Vannila sky is another film that dealt with the idea of lucid dreams, however waking life makes the lucid dream last the entire movie.  This film is a huge accomplishment for director Richard Linkliter (Dazed and Confused, and Slacker), I can't wait to see what he's cooking up next.  I highly reccomend this film for its visual appeal, if you are into those artsy type movies.  You can even watch with the volume on mute and still enjoy it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "5741  and it was a movie called &quot; slacker &quot; where a camera just goes around from person to person and they expound on their philosophy of life or just rant about whatever's in their heart and mind. i have seen two of linklater's movies, &quot; slacker&quot; and &quot; dazed and confused &quot; and i think he is a brilliant filmmaker.this however is just a revision of &quot; slacker &quot; with some new wrinkles thrown in. i would have rated this film lower, but the animation is revolutionary. he shot the movie on film, then had animation done to the film. when i watched it, it was like a peter max cartoon coming to life, plus it was entertaining enough to make me forgive linklater's slight of hand...

       "5742  \"Waking Life\", a film written and directed by Richard Linklater, is a unique animation with plenty of interesting characters and plenty to think about. Maybe a little too much, actually...The plot kind of flows in and out of the film. Basically, a young man (voiced by Wiley Wiggins) finds himself encountering a lot of interesting people, who have stories, philosophies and points of view to share - everything from destiny to dreams to free will to time to politics. It's all very interesting, and the young man is very absorbed in what they are saying, but something doesn't seem quite right about it all. He can't read his clock, for instance. He's wearing a watch that he hasn't had since fourth grade. Lights don't work when he flicks them. Could he be in a dream? If he is, what is the nature of this dream? What is its purpose? Where is it taking him? Most importantly, can he wake from it?The animation is hard to describe, which is a compliment really. In terms of motion, very often its realistic. As for shape, perspective, colors, facial experessions and such, you're only really shown a vague impression of what's there. There's also a bit of weirdness thrown in for good measure too (if someone is talking about something, for instance, the image of that something might float off in the background).I have mixed feelings about the dialogue.One good thing about it is that it feels real at times, I guess, not like a script. There's a lot of interesting concepts in the conversations, and its interesting to find that some people have thought the same things I have.Yeah, there's a lot to consider, if you can make it through all the pretentiousness. It was conversations and pretense like this that put me off going to do arts at a college. I could not live in an environment where people talk like this, and pursue such silly things under the guise of signficance. It all can be said and felt so much simpler, honestly. I mean, I can appreciate the personalities of the characters in this film. The Irish-American guy who goes on about neo-humans and the new paradigm of evolution, for instance. For all his big words and \"significant\" ideas, all he really wants is a world where people can be themselves. When he gets to that point, he uses the simplest phrase to describe how he feels about it: \"it would be nice\". Perhaps that's why he was drawn to the ideas he was discussing, maybe he could figure out a way that people can be themselves if he could create a way in his head. Perhaps the teachings he was brought up with were supposed to work, but didn't do it for him, so he got caught up trying to make things right mentally. If Richard Linklater had been trying to push point like that across, that people conjure up complex ideas to fill simple needs, I would have given the film five stars. The trouble is, he doesnt say that at all, he tries to make the film really significant, and to quote one of the characters: \"heavy\". Linklater probably acknowledges that there is some truth, if not agrees with, everything said in the film, as the points made throughout the dialogue appear as themes throughout the film. I reckon Linklatr believes these ideas really do apply to life, to \"Waking Life\" anyway.It's almost like an intellectual narcissim, these characters are so caught up in their ideas, tangled up in their own heads. They go on and on and on, like it's a great, significant revelation, like everyone should listen, like everyone should be heading in the direction they are in life. Reminds me of some friends, actually. I know a few mentally ill people and most of them are mighty, mighty perceptive philosophers. It kind of makes you wonder where the hardcore thinker stops and the delusional thinker begins. Too much learning makes you sick, like old King Solomon of Israel used to say, that's what I reckon.There's a couple of \"shocking\" moments which I thought were in a bit of bad taste. A guy, yearning to be heard by the world, pours petrol all over himself, asks Wiley Wiggins' character for a match, then sets himself on fire, for instance. The music, however was in better taste. Kind of reminded me of the way George Martin set up the string section for Beatles songs in terms of production (think Eleanor Rigby), bit artier arrangements than Martin would do though.For a little bit I dabbled in lucid dreaming, which is discussed a little in this film. My experience is a little different from the one in this film. It's true you don't have much control with light switches, but rather than staying all on or all off, I found they'd turn on, but then kind of dim a bit, like something was sapping the power somewhere else. Also, when I did actually have control of my dreams, the stuff I wanted to do just whizzed by so fast, rather than happening normally. I remember I wanted to change the color of my skin, and I went through every color I could remember in what I perceived to be seconds, the speed probably coming from the simple fact that I could make it go that fast, hyper curiousity maybe. I was really disappointed with the experience and stopped doing it. Just as well, it isn't good to muck round with that sort of thing at all.It's definitely an interesting and creative film though, and if you can handle the thick dialogue it's worth a look.   \n",
       "5743  If you enjoy hearing folks wax philosophical and don't mind spacey visuals, you may enjoy this film. Here is a sample from Robert Solomon:\"The reason why I refuse to take existentialism as just another French fashion or historical curiosity is that I think it has something very important to offer us for the new century. I'm afraid we're losing the real virtues of living life passionately, in the sense of taking responsibility for who you are, the ability to make something of yourself, and feeling good about life. Existentialism is often discussed as if it's a philosophy of despair. But I think the truth is just the opposite. Sartre, once interviewed, said he never really felt a day of despair in his life. But one thing that comes out from reading these guys is not a sense of anguish about life so much as a real kind of exuberance, of feeling on top of it. Its like: your life is yours to create.\"I've read the postmodernists with some interest, even admiration. But when I read them I always have this awful nagging feeling that something absolutely essential is getting left out. The more that you talk about a person as a social construction or as a confluence of forces or as fragmented or marginalized, what you do is you open up a whole new world of excuses. And when Sartre talks about responsibility he's not talking about something abstract. He's not talking about the kind of self or soul that theologians would argue about. It's something very concrete. It's you and me talking, making decisions, doing things, and taking the consequences.\"It might be true that there are six billion people in the world and counting, nevertheless, what you do makes a difference. It makes a difference first of all in material terms. It makes a difference to other people. And it sets an example. And in short I think the message here is that we should never simply write ourselves off and see ourselves as the victim of various forces. It's always _our_ decision who we are.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "5744  Lucid dreamers, amateur philosophers, autodidacts and fans of paint-by-numbers take note:  this movie is for you!  The film begins with a tango that sounds like Piazzola but is apparently pure Texas - a nice surprise.  The animation is reminiscent of a more detailed (and deft) paint-by-numbers style.  Squirming strokes and flat sections of color wobble and morph from cel to cel giving a sense of depth and muscularity that is more typical of fine-art painting than contemporary animation.  There are several different animator's hands in evidence, but the multiple styles are similar and complementary.  It's worth seeing just for the look of the thing.The plot, as such, is basically Wiley Wiggins walking around trying to figure out where he is, with side trips into why he is, or who he is.  The characters he meets on this ramble are intensely ordinary yet interesting, and the whole thing has a very &quot;finding ourselves&quot; college-town feel.  Even the crackpots are interesting, if only for the pure spectacle of watching an inspired lunatic perform his or her best schtick.  It does drag a bit in spots, but I suspect the scenes that will seem more or less compelling will vary from viewer to viewer.  However, I particularly loved the angry guy, the lucid dream/light switch guy, and the girl with the angular face and red sausage curls.  And if you have wondered what happened to the couple from Linklater's earlier &quot;Before Sunrise,&quot; we do find out here - a nice little valentine.There is no action to speak of, no real conclusions - just lots and lots of talk and some really gorgeous and unique animation and a fabulous soundtrack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "5745  I loved the content of this movie and thought that it really encourages one to think about their environment and the possibilities that surround them.  However, the animation almost never holds still.  For the characters, this would be fine, but while the characters are talking, you'll often find that the background waves and shifts as if you're on a boat.  I think it's supposed to lead to the \"dream\" feeling, but I mostly found it distracting and almost had to turn it off a couple times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "5746  It is a great movie! I even ordered a copy for my boyfriend, and my best friend, and they loved it too.  It is a great way to get a new perspective on your sleeping life and your waking life.  It is like a great animated version of Slacker.  Well it was directed by the same guy, so it has the same feel to it.  It doesn't have the exact same content as Slacker, but it does have similar insightful.  I love it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "5748  When I saw this movie a month ago I was lured by reviews and a love of animation. As I watched the movie it initially reminded me of the intense philosophical discussions that are often induced by &quot;getting high&quot; and the freeform way that conversations seem to progress. While I agree with these favorable reviews, I did not at the end of the movie see these as random thoughts at all. The main character that appeared to be dreaming or waking through the movie by the end I was convinced had followed his life from a young age at the beginning, tracing the memories of his life, only to realize in the end that he was not awakening from sleep. Instead he was revisiting his memories before leaving earth, gradually letting go of his life &amp; body now able to accept his death. It was comforting for me to think that maybe this is the way it could be for all of us sooner or later... or maybe I'm just crazy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "5749  This movie can be a barrage for the senses and can make you doubt what you might think is reality.  I was moved greatly by this movie and I have loved ith from the first time that I saw it.  Some of the theories in it may seem so far out there because you have never really thought about them that way before, but once they are presented to you they kinda make sense.  If you like to think outside of the box then give this movie a shot and you won't be disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "5750  I really liked this movie although it is a bit too much.  It was a very ambitious undertaking and was done well but the graphics give you a serious headache after awhile.  Not too many full length films have been made in this style and I can see why.  the interviews were interesting as long as you don't watch them all in one go.

       "5751  This movie is fun to watch when you are in a very theoretical and psychological mood.  It jumps from section to section of how people think, to why people think, to why even think.  The movie is kinda hard to watch, because of the background moving all the time, but you will get used to it.  It is a good movie to own if you want to weird out one of your friends or yourself.  I'd suggest renting it before you buy it, just on the fact that this movie is not for everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "5753  &quot;Waking Life&quot; completes (continues?) the walking-and-talking trilogy Richard Linklater started with &quot;Slackers&quot; and took up again with &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;.  It owes much to the form and content of those previous movies, borrowing &quot;Slackers&quot;s disjointed structure and &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;s unabashed romanticism.  Only this time it's not a romance between a man and a woman, but between one man's sleeping and waking life.For me, initially, this was a tough film to engage with.  The first third was terribly boring to sit through; at times it was a tough fight to keep my drooping eyes from closing for good.  The friend I saw it with wasn't as lucky, for I caught her napping early on (she later admitted that the nap I saw was actually her third, and this was during the film's first half hour!).  Frankly, this sleepiness should be expected, for the first &quot;act&quot; consists entirely of Wiley Wiggins encountering various random, verbose individuals, whom all ramble on about their great philosophical theories.  Combine the droning nature of the dialogue, the very liquid backgrounds (the animation was beautiful, true, but very hypnotic; like watching the ocean on a breezy day), and a meandering anti-narrative, and you get a sleep inducing movie.This first third was like listening to someone's long, boring dream, an observation that Linklater, appearing near the end as himself, actually cops to.  Kudos to him for admitting the inherent flaw in his movie (This flaw is also alluded to when Steven Soderbergh, in a brief cameo, tells an anecdote about how Billy Wilder described Louis Malle's upcoming $2.5 million dream-within-a-dream movie as a &quot;$2.5 million loss&quot;).  However, even though the film is preachy, pretentious, long-winded, and droning at times, I give Linklater credit for including such off-beat discussion in his relatively mainstream movie.The movie takes a drastic turn around halfway through, when Wiggins' character experiences dream lucidity in a &quot;Holy Moment&quot;.  I'll not spoil how, for it was, for me, the most exhilarating moment of the movie.  Needless to say, from this point on he is no longer a passive listener, but is allowed to engage the people he meets in thought provoking discussion. It picks up some much needed energy from this moment.  The movie changes from being a series of boring lectures (reminded me of school!) to a series of fascinating social discourses (in one of the scenes that doesn't involve Wiggins, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy seemingly revive their &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; roles, going so far as to quote their prior selves regarding a discussion they had in that movie about the division of the soul as the world's population increases -- it's much more fascinating than the way I describe it here, trust me).The animation is impressive and necessary for the kind of movie this is (in an interview, Linklater admitted that if live-action characters spoke his trippy dialogue, the audience would be hard-pressed to believe; the animation allows him to go off on tangents, work through absurd trains of thought, and generally make as much or as little sense as he wanted, just as a real dream would).  The visuals do take a while to get used to, though.  In the beginning I found myself noticing the technique more than paying attention to the dialogue.  If you let yourself, the minutiae that the artists include in the background can be quite engrossing.  That being said, with a new toy like this a lot more could have been done, which would have been distracting.  Linklater reins in his animators with a fine sense of restraint, not allowing them to go wild and fully exploit the animation to any extreme, but only go far enough to show a glimpse of its magnificent possibilities.  I was grateful for this.&quot;Waking Life&quot; is a unique movie-going experience, at least for me.  I left the theatre confused, disoriented, and mildly disappointed.  It is only after 12 hours of reflection that I realize the particular genius here.  I can't stop thinking about what it all means, and am truly glad that I saw the film.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "5756  Where to start with this one? First of all, it's visually impressive (though not absolutely mind-blowing as some have said...if you've seen a lot of animation, you've probably seen plenty of stuff this inventive), making some of the best use of rotoscoping (animated tracing over live-action figures, with animated backgrounds) that I've seen in a feature; it's got a fairly ambitious intellectual conceit (a man who may or may not be on the verge of death throughout the film dreams in a lucid way about what the nature of reality, consciousness, free will, etc really are); it's got great music (by Glover Gill)...what more could you want? Well, for starters, it works out to be not much more than philosophical ramblings, and I think to some extent it wears out its welcome. Now, if you knew me you'd know I often like long movies...I have no problem with a lot of work that a lot of people call \"slow\"; but this was to me too much of the same thing. And some of the observations are facile in a druggy-stoner way that just made me think, who cares?  Like pothead versions of Seinfeld and company, frankly.Still, adding it up, I'm thinking about it quite a lot since I first watched the excellent, feature-packed DVD a couple of years ago. Another aspect I really liked was the self-referentiality: the film as a whole is very reminiscent of the director's first feature, SLACKER; it contains a short scene with Jesse and Celine, the characters from the previous BEFORE SUNRISE that also obviously looks forward to the sequel to that film, BEFORE SUNSET; the technique used and some of the more fantastic imagery seems now a tryout for the director's later rotoscoped Philip K Dick adaptation, A SCANNER DARKLY; and both Linklater and his good friend (and fellow experimental-at-times filmmaker) Steven Soderbergh make appearances. And there's a scene or two late in the film that is reminiscent of the work of another extremely self-referential artist, the experimental American SF writer Samuel R. Delany (specificially, his 1000-page, Joycean \"Dhalgren\").I need to see it again; reading some pretty intelligent reviews this afternoon leads me to believe that a deeper reading would be more rewarding. Despite many reservations, I'm giving it high marks simply for attempting subject matter and film techniques that nobody else in America seems interested in. Linklater has proved himself a great disciple of European art cinema, not just the usual Scorsese-Coppola-DePalma stuff, and that's all to the good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "5757  The problem with most of the promotional and review material associated with this film is that it all seems to take the same starting point: namely, that Waking Life is a prettily-animated philosophical [insert preferred euphemism for \"self-abuse\" here] session. I'll concede that a large amount of time is devoted to just such activity, but I posit that Waking Life also functions as a Zen adventure story and a rather wry comedy (with humor ranging from black to cute).I took my sister and her BF to see this one at the Capitol (OFS) Theater (Olympia's arthaus of champions), expecting (as various reviews had portrayed the movie) something pretty, largely incoherent, and pretentious enough to provide plenty of unintentional fun. But WL actually posesses both plot and structure, and although some of the individual encounters the main character is involved in carry something of a pretentious air, the overall story is simple, well-integrated into the disjointed structure dictated by the overarching theme of dreaming, and (I thought) rather beautiful.Similarly, the wry humor of the movie should be mentioned in any review of WL. Many of the chuckles are character-based, like the 'go-for-broke' beer salute of the biker/dreamwalker, or the riotous cynicism of the gas-station attendent (neither my sister nor I can even think about microwavable burritos anymore without remembering his story about the vision-quester), but the occasional gonzo visual jest or uncomfortable giggle are sure to make their appearance.Finally, I'd like to say that the Phil 101 course-supplement material should be neither overvalued nor undervalued. In response to those who praise WL as the most! significant! movie! ever!, I'd like to remind that nothing particularly new is presented here, and that enlightenment-seekers would be better off hitting the shelves. To those who write it all off as simply pretentious wankery, I argue that it actually serves a purpose within the spare narrative that the movie is based around, and that although none of it is intended to be accepted at face value by the audience, contemplating the steady flow of 'ideas on feet' can have an overall mind-opening effect that helps us to identify with the drifting main character.Anyhow, I was thoroughly entertained by this movie while watching it, and it left me with a fair amount to talk about afterwards (including the topic of lucid dreaming, which can be a rewarding investigation). Not only that, but it's very much unlike anything else I've seen recently, which makes it a nice palate-cleanser for the entertainment taste buds. 4 stars, and I'm buying it when it hits DVD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "5758  This is a beguiling film, although it could be accused of instilling a sense of 'metaphysical nausea' (as one critic put it) in its viewers. The sheer breadth and depth of the theory expounded on (ranging from the thought-provoking to the truly banal) militates against any useful critique of the film: no film of a length 2 1/2 hours could possibly hope to cover everything in any remote conception of what could be termed 'sufficient detail'. The advanced rotoscoping techniques yield tremendous didvidends, with the art work enhancing instead of literalizing the visuals: crucial in a film with such unique pretensions. Expands on director Linklater's free form style along with the likes of 'Slacker' and 'Dazed and Confused', although this film is in a completely different league. Definately worth a watch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "5759  The first time I saw this movie I was sixteen. I left the theater mightily impressed by the philosophising of its dream characters. I cherished this revelatory impression of the film until I watched it again as a college sophomore, when I realized that many of the profundities upon which the film is based are flimsy at best.The science is not interpreted by scientists but by philosophers who have not grasped it in its entirety. The politics lacks depth. The movie gives off a self-important air.Only a few characters mentioned unexplored and interesting premises. I was disappointed that they were left floating while the more cliched philosophical revelations took precedence. The most telling moment of the film included a tortured novelist in - what else? - a dark cafe.Every character presented himself as an expert, so telling apart the wise from the banal was an interesting exercise.I did love the animation, however. It captivated me from the very beginning. I felt it was innovative and a pleasure to watch.The score by the Tosca Tango Orchestra is also notable.Watching the movie in an actual \"dream state\" or trance may make it more stimulating.

Thus, I had high expectations when I watched this on the Sci-Fi channel.All I have to say is: Wow! The special effects are incredible! The acting is top notch. The screenplay is well written. This film is truly a classic of cinema that will leave you thinking long after you leave the theater.Wait. That's my review for 2001: A Space Odyssey.Here's what I really think of King Kong vs. Godzilla.A thousand words cannot describe my dislike of the film. I know it's a Godzilla film, but did it need to be this bad? It starts off good, with an excellent piece of music at the beginning credits. But soon goes downhill as we are introduced to U.N Reporter Eric Carter. All he was put in for was to make the film longer and annoy us. He \"communicates\" with people in Japan via a satellite that looks more like a first grade science project than visual effects. He constantly tells us that \"Godzilla is heading for Japan\" or \"King Kong and Godzilla will battle.\" Duh! What do you think King Kong and Godzilla will do? Have tea and crumpets?Speaking of Kong, I have seen costumes that look better than this Kong suit. I would also rather listen to Celine Dion and Elton John do a music number together than listen to Kong roar. He doesn't even open his mouth! Godzilla appears just fine, except for the fact he's afraid of thermal energy (Didn't he tear down an electrical fence in 1954 with ease?). Kong however gets power from the thermal energy. Gee, I would assume that all his fur would make him the perfect conductor of elctricity. Also, doesn't anyone else notice that the islands of the first Godzilla movies (The '50s to the '70s) always look the same? The main battles themselves are also letdowns.It was a grand idea that Toho had: Pitting two titans of cinema against each other. Too bad the Japanese did not use stop motion animation. Or make a Kong/Godzilla rematch. Or make better costumes or etc, etc. For a true classic of monster cinema, King Kong, the original Godzilla or Godzilla 1985 are better choices than this pile of ... If this was the film that made Godzilla famous, he should have been assassinated.Indeed this film will leave you thinking after you leave the theater: Why did I waste my time on this?(Note: Perhaps my criticism was a bit harsh. After all, this is the American version of the movie and we always [mess] with perfection. Maybe the Japanese version is better. Get that one if you can).</td>\n",
