# Data gathering & preliminary EDA
## Objectives
Find a large number of movie reviews, 
Including the movie title,
Including multiple reviews per title


## Key hypotheses
Critique reviews such as Roger Ebert have many topics and complex prose, making
it hard to get clear mood, so I will be looking for audience reviews instead.
It's better to have multiple reviews.

##DataSets
### Amazon reviews

#### Good things about the data set
