       "      <td>The film is probably historically accurate, for the most part, except in some very key points.  I have not done extensive study on history and ancient civilizations, but I can read the Bible.  At first I was quite pleased with their faithfulness to the Biblical account, but then I believe the filmmakers departed from the written account on some of the most crucial details of the story.At certain key points, Joseph was portrayed as incapable of standing on his own, apparently needing women to help him understand what was going on, to help him forgive his brothers, etc.  That's not the Joseph I read about.  Then Pharaoh needed women to convince him that Joseph knew what he was talking about.  That is not at all the case.  (And I am not against women.)  Pharaoh was the one who immediately recognized what was in Joseph.  Genesis 41:38  \"Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?\"  He recognized that on the first encounter.  There was no second conversation with Joseph about the dreams.  Pharaoh did not dismiss him on the first encounter.What was the point of rushing down to get Joseph when he was brought back to Pharaoh, stripping his clothes off, and having two young ladies wash him from behind?  I don't read that anyone tried to scare Joseph when they told him Pharaoh wanted to see him.  Genesis 41:14 says that \"they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.\"Another reviewer writes, \"Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young...\"  What about single or married, young or old guys, watching practically R rated scenes?  I don't think people other than children are immune from being provoked.  Does an interest in history and Bible stories have to subject us to sexually explicit material?And what is the point of showing Joseph's wife in the bath?  I bet they had to shoot that scene repeatedly to keep from showing her breasts in the angles from the front, and it required split second timing in editing to keep from showing her behind as she was getting out of the pool.  Is that required to tell the story of Joseph?Some of the rest of the material might make sense if it were called the story of Genesis.  But what does the story of Joseph have to do with Judah's escapade with Tamar?  Is that really an integral part of the story of Joseph?  I think the director was glad to have a little more material, having the opportunity to show a situation with someone preparing to make out with a harlot, showing all the way up to the point where she begins to lift her dress and bare her leg, leaving the rest to your imagination.I will not dispute that two of Joseph's brothers wiped out all the males in a city as revenge for their sister being raped (Genesis 34).  Of course many details are up to the film maker, but it struck me as being unnecessary to show those same men saying, \"Praise be to God\" (or some such similar phrase) in one breath, and then plotting to kill all the males in the next breath.  Again, I'm not sure how critical that whole incident is to the story of Joseph.  Maybe it is--I won't argue too much on that point.And the Jacob (Joseph's father) we see in the film is not the Jacob I imagine.  He looked pretty weak, lacking in self-confidence, and lacking in confidence in God.  I don't think Jacob was quite so timid.  That's my personal reading of the scriptures.The story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible, but I would like to forget most of what I saw.  For me, the scene where Joseph was reunited with his brothers was weak.  What about Joseph weeping aloud, and \"the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.\"  (Genesis 45:2)  Couldn't the actor muster up that kind of emotion?Seeing the film did help me to imagine a little better what it was like when certain things happened.  Joseph crying out from the pit was particularly poignant.  But I would not recommend this film to anyone.  To me, it's not an accurate representation of what happened, and it does not portray Joseph as the strong man of God that he was.If you are watching this film to get a better understanding of the Bible, I think you should be careful. I don't think this movie was written by a Christian or directed by a Christian.  I think it could possibly just be a ploy to dupe gullible Christians into watching a sexually explicit movie (with historically accurate stuff mixed in), and slightly distorting their understanding of what actually happened.  I think we should be careful about who we rely on to interpret the Bible for us.</td>\n",

Judging by the reviews I read by others, the film continues to inaccurately portray many other critically important facts about the life of Joseph. It's not worth watching the truth of God's Holy Word twisted and profaned for the sake of enjoying ourselves with unholy entertainment.

The video makes no attempt to CLEARLY show what is being discussed and brushes over things so quickly that it is absolutely worthless. The book doesn't do any better at presenting the material. So, I held out judgement until I visited the website which was touted as an inducement to purchase this set and I didn't find anything beyond what was to be found in the book. Who knows what the cd which was included is good for? It won't work with Windows 2000 which is what I have. If the cd is of any value, it can probably be purchased elsewhere since the Moultons didn't produce it. I plan to find something else that presents the material in an easier to understand format rather than something that skims over the material while trying to impress me with amateur humor.

       "453  The film is probably historically accurate, for the most part, except in some very key points.  I have not done extensive study on history and ancient civilizations, but I can read the Bible.  At first I was quite pleased with their faithfulness to the Biblical account, but then I believe the filmmakers departed from the written account on some of the most crucial details of the story.At certain key points, Joseph was portrayed as incapable of standing on his own, apparently needing women to help him understand what was going on, to help him forgive his brothers, etc.  That's not the Joseph I read about.  Then Pharaoh needed women to convince him that Joseph knew what he was talking about.  That is not at all the case.  (And I am not against women.)  Pharaoh was the one who immediately recognized what was in Joseph.  Genesis 41:38  \"Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?\"  He recognized that on the first encounter.  There was no second conversation with Joseph about the dreams.  Pharaoh did not dismiss him on the first encounter.What was the point of rushing down to get Joseph when he was brought back to Pharaoh, stripping his clothes off, and having two young ladies wash him from behind?  I don't read that anyone tried to scare Joseph when they told him Pharaoh wanted to see him.  Genesis 41:14 says that \"they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.\"Another reviewer writes, \"Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young...\"  What about single or married, young or old guys, watching practically R rated scenes?  I don't think people other than children are immune from being provoked.  Does an interest in history and Bible stories have to subject us to sexually explicit material?And what is the point of showing Joseph's wife in the bath?  I bet they had to shoot that scene repeatedly to keep from showing her breasts in the angles from the front, and it required split second timing in editing to keep from showing her behind as she was getting out of the pool.  Is that required to tell the story of Joseph?Some of the rest of the material might make sense if it were called the story of Genesis.  But what does the story of Joseph have to do with Judah's escapade with Tamar?  Is that really an integral part of the story of Joseph?  I think the director was glad to have a little more material, having the opportunity to show a situation with someone preparing to make out with a harlot, showing all the way up to the point where she begins to lift her dress and bare her leg, leaving the rest to your imagination.I will not dispute that two of Joseph's brothers wiped out all the males in a city as revenge for their sister being raped (Genesis 34).  Of course many details are up to the film maker, but it struck me as being unnecessary to show those same men saying, \"Praise be to God\" (or some such similar phrase) in one breath, and then plotting to kill all the males in the next breath.  Again, I'm not sure how critical that whole incident is to the story of Joseph.  Maybe it is--I won't argue too much on that point.And the Jacob (Joseph's father) we see in the film is not the Jacob I imagine.  He looked pretty weak, lacking in self-confidence, and lacking in confidence in God.  I don't think Jacob was quite so timid.  That's my personal reading of the scriptures.The story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible, but I would like to forget most of what I saw.  For me, the scene where Joseph was reunited with his brothers was weak.  What about Joseph weeping aloud, and \"the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.\"  (Genesis 45:2)  Couldn't the actor muster up that kind of emotion?Seeing the film did help me to imagine a little better what it was like when certain things happened.  Joseph crying out from the pit was particularly poignant.  But I would not recommend this film to anyone.  To me, it's not an accurate representation of what happened, and it does not portray Joseph as the strong man of God that he was.If you are watching this film to get a better understanding of the Bible, I think you should be careful. I don't think this movie was written by a Christian or directed by a Christian.  I think it could possibly just be a ploy to dupe gullible Christians into watching a sexually explicit movie (with historically accurate stuff mixed in), and slightly distorting their understanding of what actually happened.  I think we should be careful about who we rely on to interpret the Bible for us.   \n",
       "524  Utterly grievous... My wife and I didn't make it past the stomach sickening, unbiblical, immoral scene where she's grabbing Joseph's jewels in the bath. We were both very disturbed. I thought I was watching a family film, not a porno-promo. Twenty minutes later and I still feel sickened. Judging by the reviews I read by others, the film continues to inaccurately portray many other critically important facts about the life of Joseph. It's not worth watching the truth of God's Holy Word twisted and profaned for the sake of enjoying ourselves with unholy entertainment. Please do not grieve the Holy Spirit by subjecting yourself to this.\"Your eye is a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light.

       "600  The acting was good, the story was correct, but naked backsides was not necessary.  Also the Potiphers wife did not need to be so very seductive of a naked Joseph. Not a Christian movie.  I felt that even though it was probably portrayed truthfully, Christans do not need to see so explicit a scene.  This should be rated PG 13 at least.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "666  This is a collection of his jokes. Not to be used as a treatment video. Others are really good but I wish I passed on this one. The worst of his \"chalk talk\" series. The rest are really good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "702  I am in the process of discovering that I wasted over one hundred dollars on this book/video combination. After watching the first several video presentations it seems as if the Moultons were more interested in slapping together a quick package to make a little extra money. The video makes no attempt to CLEARLY show what is being discussed and brushes over things so quickly that it is absolutely worthless. The book doesn't do any better at presenting the material. So, I held out judgement until I visited the website which was touted as an inducement to purchase this set and I didn't find anything beyond what was to be found in the book. Who knows what the cd which was included is good for? It won't work with Windows 2000 which is what I have. If the cd is of any value, it can probably be purchased elsewhere since the Moultons didn't produce it. I plan to find something else that presents the material in an easier to understand format rather than something that skims over the material while trying to impress me with amateur humor. If I could have rated this as zero stars, I would have. Absolutely worthless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International.

       "      <td>This film is, without a doubt, a Christian perspective on the Joseph story. Or as one of your reviewers commented, there are messianic threads cleverly interwoven throughout. For example, nowhere in the old testament does Jacob EVER say that he gives his inheritance to Joseph. This is an obvious suggestion that Jesus, descended from the tribe of Joseph (and whose nominal \"father\" is Joseph)is to inherit Gods blessings, with Christians inheriting the covenant of the Israelites. And the scene of Joseph imprisoned in the Pharaoh's prison saying to God \"why have you forsaken me\" is NOWHERE mentioned in the old testament; it is strictly put in to provide a Christian slant. Toward the end of the movie, when Joseph goes to see his father, there is a scene in which a large number of crosses appear (briefly). And incidentally, when Joseph and his father meet, the former is shown bowing down to the latter. However, as is clearly stated in the old testament, when Joseph has his dream in which the sun, moon and the stars bow before him, for this dream to be fulfilled (as are all the others in the Joseph story), Jacob (the sun) must bow down to Joseph, not the reverse. I don't have a problem with Christian Messianic films, and I in fact saw this on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, but before everyone falls all over themselves saying what a saintly film this is, please, recognise that it has been made with a specific point of view in mind, namely Christianity, and that there are other perspectives on the Joseph story that are quite different.  I think that some honesty on this subject would raise this film above the level of Christian propaganda.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This film is closer to the Biblical text of this account, than any we've yet seen....it's very emotional and very encouraging as well.  Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....\"slightly\" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the \"edit\" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).It's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to \"leaven the whole loaf\" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the \"Sampson\" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it! My family was apalled!).  Again, i say if you cannot edit the movie, DON'T BUY IT.</td>\n",

       "8     I, too, purchased this to use with my patients in early recovery, an ethnically mixed urban/suburban population who complain that their families, friends,s.o.'s \"don't get it\".  If you are purchasing this to INFORM for the first time about substance abuse and why it is difficult to \"just quit\", please choose another way.  This is overly long, meanders, imparts very little useful information, and lacks energy (I'm a therapist and it put ME to sleep). I don't think it would find a connection with an audience that is hungry for \"ah-hah\" moments and some insights into their loved one's problem.  It is basically four people (all middle aged Caucasians) sitting in a darkened room around a table asking each other what they think about a range of topics.  It could have been great--personal stories, professional insights, some science, etc., but kind of comes across as a sleepy, low budget afternoon interview show.  I will keep looking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "371   Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "443   This film is, without a doubt, a Christian perspective on the Joseph story. Or as one of your reviewers commented, there are messianic threads cleverly interwoven throughout. For example, nowhere in the old testament does Jacob EVER say that he gives his inheritance to Joseph. This is an obvious suggestion that Jesus, descended from the tribe of Joseph (and whose nominal \"father\" is Joseph)is to inherit Gods blessings, with Christians inheriting the covenant of the Israelites. And the scene of Joseph imprisoned in the Pharaoh's prison saying to God \"why have you forsaken me\" is NOWHERE mentioned in the old testament; it is strictly put in to provide a Christian slant. Toward the end of the movie, when Joseph goes to see his father, there is a scene in which a large number of crosses appear (briefly). And incidentally, when Joseph and his father meet, the former is shown bowing down to the latter. However, as is clearly stated in the old testament, when Joseph has his dream in which the sun, moon and the stars bow before him, for this dream to be fulfilled (as are all the others in the Joseph story), Jacob (the sun) must bow down to Joseph, not the reverse. I don't have a problem with Christian Messianic films, and I in fact saw this on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, but before everyone falls all over themselves saying what a saintly film this is, please, recognise that it has been made with a specific point of view in mind, namely Christianity, and that there are other perspectives on the Joseph story that are quite different.  I think that some honesty on this subject would raise this film above the level of Christian propaganda.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "481   This film is closer to the Biblical text of this account, than any we've yet seen....it's very emotional and very encouraging as well.  Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....\"slightly\" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the \"edit\" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).It's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to \"leaven the whole loaf\" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the \"Sampson\" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it! My family was apalled!).  Again, i say if you cannot edit the movie, DON'T BUY IT.   \n",
       "1016  ... the Story of the real Saint Nicholas.  If they had started with him as the real Nicholas was, priest and then Bishop of Myra, and told of some of his real miracles, and then added the fantasy elements of his transformation into the Santa Claus of today, it would have been an incredible classic.  A perfect bridge between the Rudolph/Snow Miser type specials, and the Nestor/Little Drummer Boy ones.  As it is, its a fun show with some good songs and memorable villains.  But it could have been so much more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "      <td>For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this \"American-ized\" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.In a bit of ridiculousness, the \"Ghost of Christmas Future\" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their \"Ghost of the Future\" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like \"A CHristmas Carol\" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions.</td>\n",

I almost shut it off at that scene.

       "      <td>Encyclopedia Brown (Scott Bremner) encounters a mystery surrounding a ghost town when his friends and then he meet an eerie figure on horseback.  Is the eerie figure the Wildcat Kid, a character of legend from an era long past?The beautiful young woman who inherited the ghost town is in danger of losing it to taxes.  The town is also badly decayed and in need of repair.  Perhaps there is a treasure hidden in the town that could allow the heiress to keep the town and fix it up.  While there are several people who insist there is no treasure, there seems to be a lot of action in town in addition to the appearance of the strange rider on horseback.Encyclopedia Brown (EB) is on the case as he decides there is something suspicious about the rider.  EB also wonders whether there might be something to the treasure story.  In this 30 minute television show originally made for HBO Encyclopedia Brown amazes everyone as he gets to the truth.  Encyclopedia Brown is on the case!These shows are very oriented to a younger audience.  I would say 7 - 12 year old children would enjoy this particular episode.  The age ranges are approximate because of individual interests and development.  Encyclopedia Brown explains his observations, so there are some educational elements, though the show is primarily light entertainment.  The show is a mystery for young children and will appeal to fans of the book series.</td>\n",

Funny though to be reminded how much TV you watched BEFORE a commercial break back in the early 80's (as it was a made for TV movie).  Henry Winkler does a great job playing an American/Depression era version of Mr Scrooge.  Corny (but what Christmas Carol version isn't?) but fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "283  Worth watching this new version of the classic.  It is a little slow in parts but still entertaining. The real negative issue and distraction throughout is Henry Winkler's make up that is supposed to make him look old.  It just looks like Henry Winkler with make-up that is supposed to make him look old.  Even if you did not know the actor you would know that it was makeup and not an old man.  The wig was very good though--looked very authentic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "350  For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this \"American-ized\" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.In a bit of ridiculousness, the \"Ghost of Christmas Future\" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their \"Ghost of the Future\" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like \"A CHristmas Carol\" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions.   \n",
       "532  If it weren't for the seduction scene with Potiphar's wife, this movie would have been excellent.  That scene was so sensual that it was borderline \"R\" rated in our book.  I almost shut it off at that scene.  Before the actual Biblical account of Jospeh running off, leaving his garment behind him, there is a scene in which Potiphar's wife joins him in a bathing room and (while he is in a pool) clearly and very erotically reaches her hands under the water and strokes his private parts.  He doesn't flee that time!  This scene ruined the movie for us, and though we've enjoyed other movies from this series, we couldn't keep this movie because of that one scene.  Too bad!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "741  Encyclopedia Brown (Scott Bremner) encounters a mystery surrounding a ghost town when his friends and then he meet an eerie figure on horseback.  Is the eerie figure the Wildcat Kid, a character of legend from an era long past?The beautiful young woman who inherited the ghost town is in danger of losing it to taxes.  The town is also badly decayed and in need of repair.  Perhaps there is a treasure hidden in the town that could allow the heiress to keep the town and fix it up.  While there are several people who insist there is no treasure, there seems to be a lot of action in town in addition to the appearance of the strange rider on horseback.Encyclopedia Brown (EB) is on the case as he decides there is something suspicious about the rider.  EB also wonders whether there might be something to the treasure story.  In this 30 minute television show originally made for HBO Encyclopedia Brown amazes everyone as he gets to the truth.  Encyclopedia Brown is on the case!These shows are very oriented to a younger audience.  I would say 7 - 12 year old children would enjoy this particular episode.  The age ranges are approximate because of individual interests and development.  Encyclopedia Brown explains his observations, so there are some educational elements, though the show is primarily light entertainment.  The show is a mystery for young children and will appeal to fans of the book series.                                                                                                                             \n",

       "      <td>This is my favorite rendition of the classic Dickens story \"A Christmas Carol.\"  Although the versions with George C. Scott and Patrick McNee are also very good, and I watch them at least once every holiday season, they emphasize the British and Victorian aspects of the story.  I am fond of \"An American Christmas Carol\" because it is set during the Depression and shows aspects of American society during that period.  The primary element missing from this version of the story is that Scrooge's sister and, hence, her son (Scrooge's nephew) are missing from this version, presumably in order to fit the original version within a specific time frame.  As a result the story element where the nephew's friends ridicule Scrooge's miserliness, and the corresponding redemptive element after the visitations are missing.  I felt that Henry Winkler performed the role of Scrooge admirably, even though he was only 34 at the time.  Usually the role is performed by an actor of mature years.</td>\n",

       "90   This is my favorite rendition of the classic Dickens story \"A Christmas Carol.\"  Although the versions with George C. Scott and Patrick McNee are also very good, and I watch them at least once every holiday season, they emphasize the British and Victorian aspects of the story.  I am fond of \"An American Christmas Carol\" because it is set during the Depression and shows aspects of American society during that period.  The primary element missing from this version of the story is that Scrooge's sister and, hence, her son (Scrooge's nephew) are missing from this version, presumably in order to fit the original version within a specific time frame.  As a result the story element where the nephew's friends ridicule Scrooge's miserliness, and the corresponding redemptive element after the visitations are missing.  I felt that Henry Winkler performed the role of Scrooge admirably, even though he was only 34 at the time.  Usually the role is performed by an actor of mature years.   \n",
       "119  A brilliant adaptation of Dickson's classic set in early 20th century New England.

Being a control freak, I struggled to understand even the delicate changes occurring in my son.  I spent hours, days, months researching addiction, recovery and relapse, hoping to find the magic cure.  And then I was handed, \"Why Don't They Just Quit\", the award winning self-help book written by Joe and Judy Herzanek.Joe writes a powerful and honest account of his own struggle with addiction and subsequent successful recovery, thirty years strong.  He provides valuable and often misunderstood insights from the addict's point of view, offering amazingly simple reasons for why the addict does not quit.\"Consequences became a reason for using, not a deterrent\" Joe explains as he explores reasons addicts just don't quit.  Drugs dull the senses, numb the pain and fade the situations, allowing the addict an escape from their problems. \"People use drugs to increase pleasure and decrease pain,\" writes  Joe.\"Families and friends always try to help the addict see the problem. It doesn't happen over night. They do not see the problem as it unfolds; this person typically is in denial. They will typically put this off rather than confront.\" Joe HerzanekDespite mounting pressures, whether financial, social, legal or emotional, the addict cannot see the problem for what it has become; rather the mounting pressures become the reason to continue using, in order to NOT deal with them. It seems so obvious when Joe describes the stress and the inability to deal with it that creates the vicious cycle I helplessly watched my son spiral through.Joe recounts personal failures and near tragic family circumstances as a result of addictions, but also provides a road map of sorts to navigate through the cause and progression of addiction, the treatment options as well as common sense answers to not so simple questions.In \"Why Don't They Just Quit\" Joe aptly dispels the myth of hitting rock bottom:\"This whole idea of \"hitting bottom\" is out of date. Some people with wait years-even decades- for their friends to reach thus mythical point in their alcohol and drug use. But why wait for them to \"hit bottom\"? Why not help them by raising their bottom? There are ways to encourage someone to reach their bottom much earlier. In doing so. We can avoid a lot of unnecessary pain and heartache- and maybe even save their life. For some people, hitting bottom will be six feet underground\". Joe HerzanekAs I struggled to `tough love' it with my son, I never thought of it as raising his bottom. I only looked at as a way to preserve my sanity, and then only after I attempted to help my son, which really meant enabling the behavior to continue.\"So does everyone have to hit rock bottom? I would say no. Tough love can prevent a substance abuser from prolonging their usage. There are loving ways to refuse to rescue someone that in the long run will help them to choose recovery.\"Loving means doing the right thing to help.\" Joe HerzanekJoe leaves no stone unturned when it comes to addiction and its far-reaching consequences. Addiction affects the entire family, from spouses, to parents, to siblings.Full of useful quotes and quips from both famous and not so famous, as well as personal adages from his family and friends, Joe Herzanek takes a very messy, complex and taboo subject, and twists it into a story of hope, courage and healing \"Quitting is a moment in time. It is not recovery\" Joe warns the reader.  He provides treatment options and despite being a chaplain, he tempers his own faith with the 12-step `higher power\".\"The last thing I want to do in this section is to get too preachy. Spiritual growth is very personal. What I am saying is that spirituality is a big part of recovery and is too important to ignore.\" Joe HerzanekI highly recommend this read to any person living with or loving an addict. A toolbox of helpful insights, answers to seemingly impossible questions, and road map through the struggles of addiction; this book is the ultimate idiots guide to addiction, recovery and relapse, and a must to all struggling in this realm.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This is a truly important work... one that anyone affected by substance abuse either directly or indirectly should see.When i was in art school years ago, one day a friend of mine who was also a classmate didn't show up for class. It was very unusual as he was always first there and one of the most talented and prolific artists - not only in the freshman class, but in the whole college. He was always drawing and, although very reclusive in his personal life, was well liked and admired. i learned quickly that he had overdosed. Sadness and deep grief do not even begin to describe the loss of Gary. i still feel empty when i think of him like when the wind blows, i feel like it can go right through me.The reason i was so glad to have learned of this great book and of Joe's having been there realism, is that it has given me some closure on some level about my friend. No other work has come close and for that i am eternally grateful.It's an honor for me to have a chance to write this.respectfully and with deep regard and thanks,russ</td>\n",

       "11  My 18 year old grandson has been addicted to drugs and running amok for the past 4 years. The heartaches are huge. I feel it was divine guidance for me to \"happen upon\" Joe's book and Video discussion of Why Don't They Just Quit?  The book and discussion was not only informative but so filled with hope that eventually anyone can quit if that is the choice they make. I gave the book to my grandson and he was inspired by the book. It brought comfort to me, Adam's Mom and others in the family who are struggling. It isn't over yet so this book provides us with a good roadmap from others who have travelled this road and have struggled with this issue before us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "18  Book Review: Joe Herzanek,\"Why Don't They Just Quit\"?\"Addicts and Alcoholic's aren't crazy and they can quit.\" Joe HerzanekAs the single mother of a heroin addict, I believed addiction was a complex and confusing conundrum.  Being a control freak, I struggled to understand even the delicate changes occurring in my son.  I spent hours, days, months researching addiction, recovery and relapse, hoping to find the magic cure.  And then I was handed, \"Why Don't They Just Quit\", the award winning self-help book written by Joe and Judy Herzanek.Joe writes a powerful and honest account of his own struggle with addiction and subsequent successful recovery, thirty years strong.  He provides valuable and often misunderstood insights from the addict's point of view, offering amazingly simple reasons for why the addict does not quit.\"Consequences became a reason for using, not a deterrent\" Joe explains as he explores reasons addicts just don't quit.  Drugs dull the senses, numb the pain and fade the situations, allowing the addict an escape from their problems. \"People use drugs to increase pleasure and decrease pain,\" writes  Joe.\"Families and friends always try to help the addict see the problem. It doesn't happen over night. They do not see the problem as it unfolds; this person typically is in denial. They will typically put this off rather than confront.\" Joe HerzanekDespite mounting pressures, whether financial, social, legal or emotional, the addict cannot see the problem for what it has become; rather the mounting pressures become the reason to continue using, in order to NOT deal with them. It seems so obvious when Joe describes the stress and the inability to deal with it that creates the vicious cycle I helplessly watched my son spiral through.Joe recounts personal failures and near tragic family circumstances as a result of addictions, but also provides a road map of sorts to navigate through the cause and progression of addiction, the treatment options as well as common sense answers to not so simple questions.In \"Why Don't They Just Quit\" Joe aptly dispels the myth of hitting rock bottom:\"This whole idea of \"hitting bottom\" is out of date. Some people with wait years-even decades- for their friends to reach thus mythical point in their alcohol and drug use. But why wait for them to \"hit bottom\"? Why not help them by raising their bottom? There are ways to encourage someone to reach their bottom much earlier. In doing so. We can avoid a lot of unnecessary pain and heartache- and maybe even save their life. For some people, hitting bottom will be six feet underground\". Joe HerzanekAs I struggled to `tough love' it with my son, I never thought of it as raising his bottom. I only looked at as a way to preserve my sanity, and then only after I attempted to help my son, which really meant enabling the behavior to continue.\"So does everyone have to hit rock bottom? I would say no. Tough love can prevent a substance abuser from prolonging their usage. There are loving ways to refuse to rescue someone that in the long run will help them to choose recovery.\"Loving means doing the right thing to help.\" Joe HerzanekJoe leaves no stone unturned when it comes to addiction and its far-reaching consequences. Addiction affects the entire family, from spouses, to parents, to siblings.Full of useful quotes and quips from both famous and not so famous, as well as personal adages from his family and friends, Joe Herzanek takes a very messy, complex and taboo subject, and twists it into a story of hope, courage and healing \"Quitting is a moment in time. It is not recovery\" Joe warns the reader.  He provides treatment options and despite being a chaplain, he tempers his own faith with the 12-step `higher power\".\"The last thing I want to do in this section is to get too preachy. Spiritual growth is very personal. What I am saying is that spirituality is a big part of recovery and is too important to ignore.\" Joe HerzanekI highly recommend this read to any person living with or loving an addict. A toolbox of helpful insights, answers to seemingly impossible questions, and road map through the struggles of addiction; this book is the ultimate idiots guide to addiction, recovery and relapse, and a must to all struggling in this realm.   \n",

       "28  This is a truly important work... one that anyone affected by substance abuse either directly or indirectly should see.When i was in art school years ago, one day a friend of mine who was also a classmate didn't show up for class. It was very unusual as he was always first there and one of the most talented and prolific artists - not only in the freshman class, but in the whole college. He was always drawing and, although very reclusive in his personal life, was well liked and admired. i learned quickly that he had overdosed. Sadness and deep grief do not even begin to describe the loss of Gary. i still feel empty when i think of him like when the wind blows, i feel like it can go right through me.The reason i was so glad to have learned of this great book and of Joe's having been there realism, is that it has given me some closure on some level about my friend. No other work has come close and for that i am eternally grateful.It's an honor for me to have a chance to write this.respectfully and with deep regard and thanks,russ                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "      <td>&amp;quot;Legally Blonde 2: Red, White, and Blonde&amp;quot; is the hilarious sequel to &amp;quot;Legally Blonde&amp;quot;.  It adds some details that the original left out.  It offers new features, keeping the trilogy interesting.  The plot was written wonderfully, keeping the humor and the important life messages together.  Its humor keeps the audience awaiting the next event and the outcome of every event.  Elle Wood's fight to prevent animal cruelty in Washington D.C. offers many interesting twists and turns.  They only intense more as the movie continues.  Reese Witherspoon's role as Ms. Woods lives up to the original.  All other actors offer their own humor and unforgettable quotes: Alana Ubach, Jennifer Coolidge, Luke Wilson, and legendary actors Bob Newhart and Sally Field.  The costume designs are amazing.  They offer a further unforgettable experience, especially the ones revolving around Ms. Woods.  Such movie quality makes &amp;quot;Legally Blonde 2&amp;quot; worth watching more than once.  This will keep its audiences entertained.  Those interested in watching this movie must watch the original first.  Otherwise, the plot will be confusing.</td>\n",

       "1384394  It started out so bad that I nearly left the theatre! After having positively loved the first one, I was downright shocked to see such a mess made of the second. But after 15 minutes it started to improve, and so much that by the end of the movie we were all howling with laughter and really enjoying ourselves. Silly beginning but incredible improvement. So to make a long story short: quite a good sequel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
