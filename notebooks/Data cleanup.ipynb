Warren Clark played a sterling role as Potiphar's thuggish overseer Domo Ednan, later to be Joseph's aid de camp. A deliciously evil Potiphar's Wife is captured in brilliant detail by Lesley Ann Warren and the actors playing the ten brothers also acquit themselves well staying true to the form of Israelite tribesmanThe movie begins with the purchase of Joseph by Potiphar, and his rise from that of a lowly slave to Potiphar's major domo where he captures the attention of Potiphar's evil wife, when he resists her attention and she accuses him of assaulting her, Potiphar soon knows he is innocent, and he embarks on the telling of his story of his boyhood, including the narrative of the rape of his half-sister  Dinah (played with shyness and prettiness by Mexican actress Paloma Baeza), and the destruction of the Canaanite town of Schechem  in revenge by her brothers Simeon (Vincenzo Nicoli) and Levi (Colin Bruce) Then we move to the central story whose tale baring and father's favour lead to his brother's brutal attack of him, where he is thrown into a pit and sold to Ishmaelite traders.His rise in prison, his interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh (Stefano Dionisi) at the same time as we are taken back to Canaan and see the story of Tamar( a pert and beautiful Kelly Miller ) and Judah (Michael Attwell). The final sequence where Joseph's brothers go down to Egypt until the moving scene where he reveals himself to his brothers is the finest.The sex scenes are tasteful and not at all gratuitous in any way , and yes this is an adult movie, but they simply cover what is told in the Bible without going further and it is extremely narrow minded to find them offensive</td>\n",

       "      <td>There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries.  \"Joseph\" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts, and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here.  I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  \"Joseph\" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you.</td>\n",

What I hadn't realized as a child was just how embarrassingly racist movies back then could be.  None of the antagonists have too much intelligence, but the Native-American Indian is portrayed to be especially idiotic.  I'll still show the movie to my daughter this Thanksgiving and use it as a springboard for meaningful discussion, but I'm sure I'll be cringing along the way.

The story is narrated by Fred Astaire, with character voices by Keenan Wynn and Mickey Rooney.  The music is marvelous and the story is enchanting.  It answers the burning questions we all have about Santa.  Why is he called Kris Kringle?  Why does he wear a red suit and have whiskers?  How did he meet Mrs. Klaus?  How did he come to bring toys to children by going down the chimey and why is his workshop at the North Pole?  What is the origin of Christmas trees and how do reindeer fly?All these great mysteries are revealed in this magical tale about Christmas' most famous and beloved figure.  It follows his life from the time he was an infant all the way to the jolly and rotund fellow we know and love today.This charming story is an excellent addition to any child's holiday collection.  I rate it a 10/10.  It is one of my favorite Christmas shorts and it is perfect for children from two to ninety two years old.</td>\n",

It will always keep the whole family entertained.  A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.Under dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children's living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.Various facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960's anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!Determined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.Whether this screenplay is actually true, seeing Santa Claus as a young man has always been very interesting. It's a perspective which so many other people have not addressed. This remains one of the more original holiday specials.</td>\n",

Ironically, if it hadn't been for the woman going out in search of Rudolph, all the men would have probably died. Still, I think some of the comments made were a real depiction of the mindset of the time period and it makes me laugh every time I watch it. Everytime Rudolph's Daddy says that, I look at my fiance' and (jokingly) say \"That's right! You heard him! It's MAN's Work!\"A great holiday classic full of laughter, fun and adventure. And the story of Rudolph speaks to one thing in particular. Our differences make us unique but those differences don't have to be a hinderance. They can be a gift. In the hands of a powerful spirit, a weakness can be transformed into a strength.Thanks for teaching generations of kids that very valuable lesson!</td>\n",

In the meat section, you learn how to pan fry a steak and how to deglaze the pan and make a sauce. Then you have essentially the same thing for a pork chop and a veal cutlet. You learn how to make a pot roast, followed by the same instructions but with chunks of meat to make beef stew. In the vegetable section, you learn how to boil various vegetables and finish them off with a dab of butter. Very basic. Lots of butter, heavy cream, and wine or vermouth added to almost every dish. The videography is not very well-lit for close-ups, so some of the food looks rather unappealing. I think this would be useful for someone who wants to cook basic American food and only knows how to microwave.

Thanks so much for such a wonderful work-It did make me wish I knew of something since my childhood that I always wanted to do-  BUT, I am encouraged to search my heart.. hands held on top of it... for the answer-Buy it or stream it.... invite some friends over and watch...We watched it with one hand on the pause button and we stopped and discussed sections all the way through-  takes longer-  but great conversations were had.  Wonderful way to spend an evening.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I chose this vehicle because it points to God Himself as the absolute truth! For truth is not a concept ...Truth is a Person, that Person is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, He is the only One who is perfect in showing the truth, coming to testify of the truth. for example, one might hear as a common statement that the truth shall set you free! that statement by itself, is not entirely the whole truth. in the gospel of John chapter 8 verese 31 it says &amp;#34; So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, if you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.&amp;#34; God's truth over man's tradition is what I need daily. the true Christmas story is that God came to mankind, born in the flesh, ( in which the Old testment clearly points to Jesus's coming) He, being God, the Son, would stiil remain 100% God and 100% man at the same time, never breaking any of God's own commands, but fulfilling them perfectly. Living to please God the Father, suffered and shed His own blood for the sins of the world, was cruxcified and was buried and on the third day, God raised Him from the dead, He ascended into heaven adn sits at the right ahnd of the Father and He will come again to judge the living and the dead. those who believe Him, not just believe in Him, He will give eternal live, those who don't trust and believe Him will suffer eternal punishment. personally, I trust in His work and not mine, It is not because I am better than any other person that has lived or will ever lived, it's is that I am just as bad off as any other person, except thanks be the God for His Son, my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. again, i used to say that honesty is the best policy, therefore, that statement in and of itself doesn't go far enoug.... HONESTY IS THE ONLY POLICY!  there is a differnce between a truth and a lie... and if one doesn't know the difference one will believe the the lie .... a truth and a lie are complete opposites, except for one place, they are both believable. it is interesting that right in the middle of the word believe you find a lie .... beLIEve... remember</td>\n",

       "      <td>This is a disturbing, yet beautifully filmed, brutal, hard-to-watch, makes you think movie, and in a way has it's place as a \"must see.\" However, the scourging of Christ here is WAY over the top. I mean he would be dead by the time he started carrying the cross in this movie. He literally has no skin by the time they make him carry his burden and they keep whipping him. By the time they flip him over while he's nailed and raise him up, he'd be a corpse. I know he's the son of God, and it's a modern depiction of the passion play made popular in the middle ages, and the weight of our sins is represented symbollically in the amount of pain portrayed, but it's misleading to say it's historically accurate in this aspect. Yeah cruxifiction was brutal, but this is ridiculous. Gibson needs some mental help.Besides the gratuitous bloodbath, I think the main thing that keeps this from being a classic is Gibson, after 2 hours of horrifying torture, gives about 15 seconds portraying the most important part of the story: The Resurrection. Yes, Christ died terribly for all of our sins but it's when he RISES from this death that finally justifies his claim as \"Son of God.\" Check out the end of \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" to see how powerful the Resurrection can be potrayed, then imagine how great it could've been with this movie's special FX and mood. I just think it would've given more hope at the end, which is the point of the \"story\". We watch this man graphically die, now show us the rest of it and how he's MORE than a man. Gibson shows him getting up and running away, but that's it. No ascension into heaven and it kind of loses the spirituality of the conclusion of Christ's time on earth. His greatest moment wasn't the cruxifiction, it was his rebirth and this movie misses the point.Now if only Caviezal and Gibson would do a prequal, only without the over the top, gratuitous B-horror movie violence that makes \"Braveheart\" look like a G-rated kiddie flick.</td>\n",

Ranks up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and any Romero film. I actually was laughing near the end of it because of how over the top this movie is. How anyone can get a religious experience out of this is beyond me. Not to mention how hypocritical the religious nuts are to say they condemn violence yet they love this movie. Well if you are a horror film fan who appreciates good make up and gore then this ranks up there with some of the best. Who would have thunk that Mel Gibson would make one the goriest violent films of all time that would appeal to two different groups. As far as content goes and story line, this is not the movie for you. There is nothing of substance here, nope just two hours of beatings and torture.</td>\n",

       "6   I am always skeptical of hollywood productions of anything true but this is about as good as it could get.  A few variations from the true story, but they were minor.  Their take on the issues surrounding this family demonstrates they listenend to the advice they got from Old Testament experts who actually believe the Bible.  It was not only well written, but the acting was superb!  We have read the biblical story many times, but found ourselves mesmerized by this movie version.

       "8   This is a brilliant epic movie, a tour de force, the best Biblical movie I have seen with the exception ofOne Night with the KingStarring Paul Mercurio in the title role, he gives an intelligent and passionate performance of a man who was prepared to die, to keep to the word of his G-D.Ben Kingsley is his usual magnificent self in his role of Potiphar which he plays with panache. Warren Clark played a sterling role as Potiphar's thuggish overseer Domo Ednan, later to be Joseph's aid de camp. A deliciously evil Potiphar's Wife is captured in brilliant detail by Lesley Ann Warren and the actors playing the ten brothers also acquit themselves well staying true to the form of Israelite tribesmanThe movie begins with the purchase of Joseph by Potiphar, and his rise from that of a lowly slave to Potiphar's major domo where he captures the attention of Potiphar's evil wife, when he resists her attention and she accuses him of assaulting her, Potiphar soon knows he is innocent, and he embarks on the telling of his story of his boyhood, including the narrative of the rape of his half-sister  Dinah (played with shyness and prettiness by Mexican actress Paloma Baeza), and the destruction of the Canaanite town of Schechem  in revenge by her brothers Simeon (Vincenzo Nicoli) and Levi (Colin Bruce) Then we move to the central story whose tale baring and father's favour lead to his brother's brutal attack of him, where he is thrown into a pit and sold to Ishmaelite traders.His rise in prison, his interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh (Stefano Dionisi) at the same time as we are taken back to Canaan and see the story of Tamar( a pert and beautiful Kelly Miller ) and Judah (Michael Attwell). The final sequence where Joseph's brothers go down to Egypt until the moving scene where he reveals himself to his brothers is the finest.The sex scenes are tasteful and not at all gratuitous in any way , and yes this is an adult movie, but they simply cover what is told in the Bible without going further and it is extremely narrow minded to find them offensive                                                                                                    \n",
       "9   This is the finest Biblical epoch we have ever seen, including Ben Hur and 10 Commandments.  A low budget testament to the power of imagination and good acting.  Remarkably faithful to both to historical and scriptural sources, the script brings life to an  already marvelous tale of alienation, faith and redemption.  The tragic family of Isaac is beautifully portrayed with every character (including all 12 brothers) skillfully defined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "10  There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries.  \"Joseph\" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts, and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here.  I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  \"Joseph\" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.

Great acting for most of it.  towards the end the main character loses me a little bit, but for the most part I like it a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "15  I purchased this video for my daughter, remembering it fondly from my own elementary school days ( I think I watched on reel-to-reel...).  I like the way it portrays the faith of the Pilgrim-Separatists, so often lacking in more modern recounts of the first Thanksgiving.  I also love the theme song (Ma-a-a-yflower, Ma-a-a-yflower...)--it brings back warm childhood memories.  What I hadn't realized as a child was just how embarrassingly racist movies back then could be.  None of the antagonists have too much intelligence, but the Native-American Indian is portrayed to be especially idiotic.  I'll still show the movie to my daughter this Thanksgiving and use it as a springboard for meaningful discussion, but I'm sure I'll be cringing along the way.  It's just not as good as I thought I remembered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "19  This is so lame! The songs are terrible! The villan is a ripoff of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons while the kids look like they're on loan from a Charlie Brown show.

       "21  This wonderful 1970 video, using stop-motion animation, tells the story of Santa Claus in a most delightful way.  The story is narrated by Fred Astaire, with character voices by Keenan Wynn and Mickey Rooney.  The music is marvelous and the story is enchanting.  It answers the burning questions we all have about Santa.  Why is he called Kris Kringle?  Why does he wear a red suit and have whiskers?  How did he meet Mrs. Klaus?  How did he come to bring toys to children by going down the chimey and why is his workshop at the North Pole?  What is the origin of Christmas trees and how do reindeer fly?All these great mysteries are revealed in this magical tale about Christmas' most famous and beloved figure.  It follows his life from the time he was an infant all the way to the jolly and rotund fellow we know and love today.This charming story is an excellent addition to any child's holiday collection.  I rate it a 10/10.  It is one of my favorite Christmas shorts and it is perfect for children from two to ninety two years old.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "23  With such big names as Mickey Rooney and Fred Astaire donnating their vocal talents, this 1970 stop-animation Rankin-Bass special attempted to explain how Santa Claus came into being.  It will always keep the whole family entertained.  A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.Under dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children's living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.Various facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960's anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!Determined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.Whether this screenplay is actually true, seeing Santa Claus as a young man has always been very interesting. It's a perspective which so many other people have not addressed. This remains one of the more original holiday specials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "26  I love how this movie not only tells a story but depicts the times in which it was made. The Doe stay at home in the cave while Rudolph's Dad and Santa go out and do the \"Man's work\" (to use his words) of searching for Rudolph. Ironically, if it hadn't been for the woman going out in search of Rudolph, all the men would have probably died. Still, I think some of the comments made were a real depiction of the mindset of the time period and it makes me laugh every time I watch it. Everytime Rudolph's Daddy says that, I look at my fiance' and (jokingly) say \"That's right! You heard him! It's MAN's Work!\"A great holiday classic full of laughter, fun and adventure. And the story of Rudolph speaks to one thing in particular. Our differences make us unique but those differences don't have to be a hinderance. They can be a gift. In the hands of a powerful spirit, a weakness can be transformed into a strength.Thanks for teaching generations of kids that very valuable lesson!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "28  Julia is delightful, as always. However, the cooking here is very basic and rather repetitive. In the meat section, you learn how to pan fry a steak and how to deglaze the pan and make a sauce. Then you have essentially the same thing for a pork chop and a veal cutlet. You learn how to make a pot roast, followed by the same instructions but with chunks of meat to make beef stew. In the vegetable section, you learn how to boil various vegetables and finish them off with a dab of butter. Very basic. Lots of butter, heavy cream, and wine or vermouth added to almost every dish. The videography is not very well-lit for close-ups, so some of the food looks rather unappealing. I think this would be useful for someone who wants to cook basic American food and only knows how to microwave. But if you are already buying fresh ingredients and putting meals on the table, this will not really teach you much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "33  I loved this movie-  actually I love all movies like this-  I NEVER get tired of hearing about someone's personal life experience and how they have transcended their issues-  As it has been said-  \"There is only one of us here\"...  so the journey of another always holds much interest for me.It is beautiful to watch...  a stunning visual feast-  I want to meet all in the cast and crew and tell them how much I was inspired and moved by the whole film.  It was pure positive energy streaming through the tv to my heart.  Thanks so much for such a wonderful work-It did make me wish I knew of something since my childhood that I always wanted to do-  BUT, I am encouraged to search my heart.. hands held on top of it... for the answer-Buy it or stream it.... invite some friends over and watch...We watched it with one hand on the pause button and we stopped and discussed sections all the way through-  takes longer-  but great conversations were had.  Wonderful way to spend an evening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "35  I chose this vehicle because it points to God Himself as the absolute truth! For truth is not a concept ...Truth is a Person, that Person is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, He is the only One who is perfect in showing the truth, coming to testify of the truth. for example, one might hear as a common statement that the truth shall set you free! that statement by itself, is not entirely the whole truth. in the gospel of John chapter 8 verese 31 it says &#34; So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, if you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.&#34; God's truth over man's tradition is what I need daily. the true Christmas story is that God came to mankind, born in the flesh, ( in which the Old testment clearly points to Jesus's coming) He, being God, the Son, would stiil remain 100% God and 100% man at the same time, never breaking any of God's own commands, but fulfilling them perfectly. Living to please God the Father, suffered and shed His own blood for the sins of the world, was cruxcified and was buried and on the third day, God raised Him from the dead, He ascended into heaven adn sits at the right ahnd of the Father and He will come again to judge the living and the dead. those who believe Him, not just believe in Him, He will give eternal live, those who don't trust and believe Him will suffer eternal punishment. personally, I trust in His work and not mine, It is not because I am better than any other person that has lived or will ever lived, it's is that I am just as bad off as any other person, except thanks be the God for His Son, my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. again, i used to say that honesty is the best policy, therefore, that statement in and of itself doesn't go far enoug.... HONESTY IS THE ONLY POLICY!  there is a differnce between a truth and a lie... and if one doesn't know the difference one will believe the the lie .... a truth and a lie are complete opposites, except for one place, they are both believable. it is interesting that right in the middle of the word believe you find a lie .... beLIEve... remember   \n",

       "38  This is a disturbing, yet beautifully filmed, brutal, hard-to-watch, makes you think movie, and in a way has it's place as a \"must see.\" However, the scourging of Christ here is WAY over the top. I mean he would be dead by the time he started carrying the cross in this movie. He literally has no skin by the time they make him carry his burden and they keep whipping him. By the time they flip him over while he's nailed and raise him up, he'd be a corpse. I know he's the son of God, and it's a modern depiction of the passion play made popular in the middle ages, and the weight of our sins is represented symbollically in the amount of pain portrayed, but it's misleading to say it's historically accurate in this aspect. Yeah cruxifiction was brutal, but this is ridiculous. Gibson needs some mental help.Besides the gratuitous bloodbath, I think the main thing that keeps this from being a classic is Gibson, after 2 hours of horrifying torture, gives about 15 seconds portraying the most important part of the story: The Resurrection. Yes, Christ died terribly for all of our sins but it's when he RISES from this death that finally justifies his claim as \"Son of God.\" Check out the end of \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" to see how powerful the Resurrection can be potrayed, then imagine how great it could've been with this movie's special FX and mood. I just think it would've given more hope at the end, which is the point of the \"story\". We watch this man graphically die, now show us the rest of it and how he's MORE than a man. Gibson shows him getting up and running away, but that's it. No ascension into heaven and it kind of loses the spirituality of the conclusion of Christ's time on earth. His greatest moment wasn't the cruxifiction, it was his rebirth and this movie misses the point.Now if only Caviezal and Gibson would do a prequal, only without the over the top, gratuitous B-horror movie violence that makes \"Braveheart\" look like a G-rated kiddie flick.                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "39  Well this is one of the best gore movies I have ever seen. Pretty much that is what this movie is. 2 hours of a man being beaten and tortured. Ranks up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and any Romero film. I actually was laughing near the end of it because of how over the top this movie is. How anyone can get a religious experience out of this is beyond me. Not to mention how hypocritical the religious nuts are to say they condemn violence yet they love this movie. Well if you are a horror film fan who appreciates good make up and gore then this ranks up there with some of the best. Who would have thunk that Mel Gibson would make one the goriest violent films of all time that would appeal to two different groups. As far as content goes and story line, this is not the movie for you. There is nothing of substance here, nope just two hours of beatings and torture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "41  This movie came 400 years too late. We might've belived in all this nonsense in the 14th century but for an adult to be brainwashed to the extent that they actually take this fairytale for real is scary. You don't belive in Zeus. You're an atheist to Poseidon and Allah. So you know what it's like to be an atheist. Normal people just go one god further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "11    I have watched this version of &#34;Joseph&#34; numerous times also on TV and am once again glad to add this one to my collection of Bible DVD's. It's entertainment but for me it's much than that I'm able to receive a better understanding of my Bible it's like a learning process to test me on my Bible knowledge and see how well I know the scriptures, for instance when I'm able to pick something out of the movie that may not be quite true to scripture I go check my Bible and I'm able to learn my scriptures better and my Bible. I believe by watching the DVD over and over and even having different versions you absorb more into your memory and it can be your own individual Bible study. I was really amazed and excited when I saw that you offered many of these DVD's of (The Bible Collection) which are some of my favorites. Hoping to collect them all and other versions plus other Christian DVD's to learn from them for a better understanding of God's true Word.\n",

I wonder how many youngsters (Food Network viewers) will purchase or have purchased for them the classic \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" and find it completely overwhelming and not necessarily useful for everyday cooking?I had few cooking skills in the mid 1980s when this book and DVD came out, and I relied on recipes from Fannie Farmer, supermarket recipe cards, and women's magazines.  This series elevated my cooking for good.  It is French influenced, but simplified in some cases, and there are variations on most recipes which is really useful if you don't have time to run to the supermarket.  I have had many variation cookbooks and this is the best.  I have not used the dessert section too much (I prefer Pierre Franey for this--fruit salad with Grand Marnier!), but the bread, meat, and veg sections are the best.  I recommend ham steaks with peas and mashed potatoes and cornish game hen broiled w/cheese.I am so pleased this is out on DVD.  I gathered up the video tapes one-by-one on ebay and this is definitely more affordable!</td>\n",

       "      <td>To start off with, I actually have an early release of the dvd, so my stars are based on that, not the cinema.I made it through about six or seven pages on reviews before I decided to write this and from what I see, three subjects usually appear as the reason for bad reviews.The first reason is it is too violent.  We all knew this, before we even went to see it.  It was all over news, media, etc.  We were warned not to take our kids, be prepared for violence, not for the weak of heart.  So, if you went expecting scenes of the beach, then that is your own fault.  I didn't watch it hoping to see a blood bath, but I knew it was coming.I am a very faithful Protestant, and I do see some Catholic overtones in the story, but that is Mel's interpretation and overall I felt it was pretty accurate.  It is interesting to me that all of these people that may or may not have a personal relationship with Jesus, seem to know that if he were here today, he would not support this film.The second reason people complain is because it doesn't tell the full story of Jesus.  It isn't supposed to.  It is the Passion of the Christ, and passion means suffering.  It isn't the story of the Christ or the Gospel of the Christ.  It is basically a Passion play put to cinema.  He isn't trying to show us the teachings of Jesus, he is showing us the suffering of Jesus.  He is showing us what He went through for us.  If you see this movie and aren't moved by the sacrifice that He made for all of us to be free, then you don't get it.  And if you don't understand and you don't get it, then that is ok, I pray someday that you will.The third thing I pick up on in these reviews is that Mel is using it just for profit.  He has made money at ever other movie he has made I am sure, and yet no one ever questions his motives then.  Yet, when he comes out with something of a religious nature when we are in a world that requires us to be politically correct, then he was just doing it for money.  He put up his own money and I personally hope he makes all the money he can off of it, not that he needs it.  So what if there is a director's cut later on?  How may different directors editions or box sets of Lord of the Rings are out there?  I get tired of having to apologize for what I believe.  If someone stands up for an important issue, whatever the hot topic of the week is, then that is their right to voice their opinion and they expect everyone to recieve it and agree.  But if I as a Christian stand up for what I believe, then I am a \"Jesus Freak\" or a \"Fanatic\".  So if you don't agree with me, that is your right, but if I don't believe what you do, then I am narrow minded??  What happened to my right to my own beliefs?While I am still on my soap box, it is amazing to me that people still think this film is anti-semitic.  If you have any knowledge of the history prior to this then you should know that Jews were a large part of this area, so who else would send Jesus to the cross?  He was Jewish, it was just the circumstances.  And if you don't know the history, then read the bible, don't blame Gibson.Back to the movie, I liked the dvd, thought it was a great movie.  I tip my hat to Mel Gibson for having the courage to put his money where his mouth is and put his beliefs to film.God Bless</td>\n",

       "      <td>I have never seen a movie as intensley astounding in performance as that of \"The Passion Of The Christ\".  I am 39 years old and I cannot find the words to express to anyone the expanse, magnitude and brilliance that this movie of The Final hours of Jesus Christ has left within me other than an imprint  as deep within as the mystery of the universe itself.As a young catholic growing up, I remember seeing the movie on TV called, \"Francis of Assisi\", starring Bradford Dillman, Dolores Hart (who became an actual nun in 1971) and Stuart Whitman.  It was and is one of the greatest movies in the history of Religious Film Making with The Passion of The Christ as Number One and Francis as Number two.  No film of St. Francis or any kind then, made such an impression on me, that I actually took His name as mine for my Confirmation Name because I became so \"hypnotized\", if you will, that I became more aware that anyone can desire such holiness and attain such (Holy) Valor as Francis did, for me, when I was only 11.Buy this film!!  See \"The Passion of The Christ\" Come Alive for you as you have never seen anything like it ever before!!!So that to see for yourselves what Jesus went through in His Final Hours for our redemption and to accomplish for us something so beautiful through such anguish and pain never before witnessed, that to this day, as I hold the DVD in my hands still unwrapped since I saw it on The Big Screen, it remains in me, as if imprinted on my very soul.Maybe a person may see this film as an atheist and leave it as an atheist, but I know one thing.  They will never die as one, as it is said, likewise, that \"there are no atheists in fox holes\".Peace of \"The Christ\" be with you!RJ</td>\n",

       "      <td>I frankly don't know how anybody could dislike this film.  I cannot think of many superior cinemagraphic experiences than viewing \"The Passion of the Chirst.\"  With the soldiers and the Pharisees, it is nearly unfathomable that such hate could be conjured up for one's fellow human beings but there are endless reminders around us today which document that such hate still exists.  Christ in particular remains despised in numerous hearts and locales.The artistic merits of \"The Passion...\" are weighty.  Merely hearing Aramaic and Latin for two hours straight is valuable in itself.  All of the acting is strong and this is even true of the minor roles as one's outrage at the individual soldiers is palpable.The choice for Satan was fascinating as I don't recall ever seeing a more perfectly androgynous human being captured on the big screen.  The way that Mel Gibson \"fleshed out\" Pilate was stupendous, and quite surprising.  In the context of the times, it is possible to feel sympathy for him.  The very small things are what makes the film uniquely memorable, such as the use of flashbacks, the motif of the dove, and the death scene of Judas.  I loved this movie and the DVD was worth the 20 bucks I paid.  Never in my life have I wanted more to more change an ending and never in my life have I been as powerless to do so.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I've noticed that many reviewers are complaining because there are no extras on this DVD.  So what!?!  The point of this movie isn't what Mel Gibson or any of the actors think.  The point is what's happening on the screen.  If you don't get that, you don't get the message.  Why cloud the true message with a bunch of talking heads who are only going to say what's been said in countless magazine/newspaper interviews?  This is a powerful movie that needs no explanation.  It captures a part of Jesus' life that has been overly sanitized.  We (Christians) know that Jesus died for us, but how many of us have actually considered \"how\" he died for us?  Watching this movie should make a lot of people sit up and take notice.  It's not an easy movie to watch, but once again, that's the point.  You're supposed to feel uncomfortable.  You're supposed to be horrified by the brutality and callousness of what happened to the Son of God.  Mel Gibson did a magnificent job of capturing the last hours of Jesus' life.  He didn't sugarcoat anything; he didn't downplay any of the \"ugly\" aspects.  I respect him and this movie for that.  This is definitely a movie that stays with you after you watch it.  Hopefully, if you watched it in the right frame of mind, the true message should stay with you for the rest of your life.</td>\n",

       "30  What with Meryl Streep portraying her in a movie and all, Julia's books and series are getting a monster tidal wave of fresh attention.  I wonder how many youngsters (Food Network viewers) will purchase or have purchased for them the classic \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" and find it completely overwhelming and not necessarily useful for everyday cooking?I had few cooking skills in the mid 1980s when this book and DVD came out, and I relied on recipes from Fannie Farmer, supermarket recipe cards, and women's magazines.  This series elevated my cooking for good.  It is French influenced, but simplified in some cases, and there are variations on most recipes which is really useful if you don't have time to run to the supermarket.  I have had many variation cookbooks and this is the best.  I have not used the dessert section too much (I prefer Pierre Franey for this--fruit salad with Grand Marnier!), but the bread, meat, and veg sections are the best.

I gathered up the video tapes one-by-one on ebay and this is definitely more affordable!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "37  To start off with, I actually have an early release of the dvd, so my stars are based on that, not the cinema.I made it through about six or seven pages on reviews before I decided to write this and from what I see, three subjects usually appear as the reason for bad reviews.The first reason is it is too violent.  We all knew this, before we even went to see it.  It was all over news, media, etc.  We were warned not to take our kids, be prepared for violence, not for the weak of heart.  So, if you went expecting scenes of the beach, then that is your own fault.  I didn't watch it hoping to see a blood bath, but I knew it was coming.I am a very faithful Protestant, and I do see some Catholic overtones in the story, but that is Mel's interpretation and overall I felt it was pretty accurate.  It is interesting to me that all of these people that may or may not have a personal relationship with Jesus, seem to know that if he were here today, he would not support this film.The second reason people complain is because it doesn't tell the full story of Jesus.  It isn't supposed to.  It is the Passion of the Christ, and passion means suffering.  It isn't the story of the Christ or the Gospel of the Christ.  It is basically a Passion play put to cinema.  He isn't trying to show us the teachings of Jesus, he is showing us the suffering of Jesus.  He is showing us what He went through for us.  If you see this movie and aren't moved by the sacrifice that He made for all of us to be free, then you don't get it.  And if you don't understand and you don't get it, then that is ok, I pray someday that you will.The third thing I pick up on in these reviews is that Mel is using it just for profit.  He has made money at ever other movie he has made I am sure, and yet no one ever questions his motives then.  Yet, when he comes out with something of a religious nature when we are in a world that requires us to be politically correct, then he was just doing it for money.  He put up his own money and I personally hope he makes all the money he can off of it, not that he needs it.  So what if there is a director's cut later on?  How may different directors editions or box sets of Lord of the Rings are out there?  I get tired of having to apologize for what I believe.  If someone stands up for an important issue, whatever the hot topic of the week is, then that is their right to voice their opinion and they expect everyone to recieve it and agree.  But if I as a Christian stand up for what I believe, then I am a \"Jesus Freak\" or a \"Fanatic\".  So if you don't agree with me, that is your right, but if I don't believe what you do, then I am narrow minded??  What happened to my right to my own beliefs?While I am still on my soap box, it is amazing to me that people still think this film is anti-semitic.  If you have any knowledge of the history prior to this then you should know that Jews were a large part of this area, so who else would send Jesus to the cross?  He was Jewish, it was just the circumstances.  And if you don't know the history, then read the bible, don't blame Gibson.Back to the movie, I liked the dvd, thought it was a great movie.  I tip my hat to Mel Gibson for having the courage to put his money where his mouth is and put his beliefs to film.God Bless   \n",
       "40  I have never seen a movie as intensley astounding in performance as that of \"The Passion Of The Christ\".  I am 39 years old and I cannot find the words to express to anyone the expanse, magnitude and brilliance that this movie of The Final hours of Jesus Christ has left within me other than an imprint  as deep within as the mystery of the universe itself.As a young catholic growing up, I remember seeing the movie on TV called, \"Francis of Assisi\", starring Bradford Dillman, Dolores Hart (who became an actual nun in 1971) and Stuart Whitman.  It was and is one of the greatest movies in the history of Religious Film Making with The Passion of The Christ as Number One and Francis as Number two.  No film of St. Francis or any kind then, made such an impression on me, that I actually took His name as mine for my Confirmation Name because I became so \"hypnotized\", if you will, that I became more aware that anyone can desire such holiness and attain such (Holy) Valor as Francis did, for me, when I was only 11.Buy this film!!  See \"The Passion of The Christ\" Come Alive for you as you have never seen anything like it ever before!!!So that to see for yourselves what Jesus went through in His Final Hours for our redemption and to accomplish for us something so beautiful through such anguish and pain never before witnessed, that to this day, as I hold the DVD in my hands still unwrapped since I saw it on The Big Screen, it remains in me, as if imprinted on my very soul.Maybe a person may see this film as an atheist and leave it as an atheist, but I know one thing.  They will never die as one, as it is said, likewise, that \"there are no atheists in fox holes\".Peace of \"The Christ\" be with you!RJ                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "42  I frankly don't know how anybody could dislike this film.  I cannot think of many superior cinemagraphic experiences than viewing \"The Passion of the Chirst.\"  With the soldiers and the Pharisees, it is nearly unfathomable that such hate could be conjured up for one's fellow human beings but there are endless reminders around us today which document that such hate still exists.  Christ in particular remains despised in numerous hearts and locales.The artistic merits of \"The Passion...\" are weighty.  Merely hearing Aramaic and Latin for two hours straight is valuable in itself.  All of the acting is strong and this is even true of the minor roles as one's outrage at the individual soldiers is palpable.The choice for Satan was fascinating as I don't recall ever seeing a more perfectly androgynous human being captured on the big screen.  The way that Mel Gibson \"fleshed out\" Pilate was stupendous, and quite surprising.  In the context of the times, it is possible to feel sympathy for him.  The very small things are what makes the film uniquely memorable, such as the use of flashbacks, the motif of the dove, and the death scene of Judas.  I loved this movie and the DVD was worth the 20 bucks I paid.  Never in my life have I wanted more to more change an ending and never in my life have I been as powerless to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "44  I've noticed that many reviewers are complaining because there are no extras on this DVD.  So what!?!  The point of this movie isn't what Mel Gibson or any of the actors think.  The point is what's happening on the screen.  If you don't get that, you don't get the message.  Why cloud the true message with a bunch of talking heads who are only going to say what's been said in countless magazine/newspaper interviews?  This is a powerful movie that needs no explanation.  It captures a part of Jesus' life that has been overly sanitized.  We (Christians) know that Jesus died for us, but how many of us have actually considered \"how\" he died for us?  Watching this movie should make a lot of people sit up and take notice.  It's not an easy movie to watch, but once again, that's the point.  You're supposed to feel uncomfortable.  You're supposed to be horrified by the brutality and callousness of what happened to the Son of God.  Mel Gibson did a magnificent job of capturing the last hours of Jesus' life.  He didn't sugarcoat anything; he didn't downplay any of the \"ugly\" aspects.  I respect him and this movie for that.  This is definitely a movie that stays with you after you watch it.  Hopefully, if you watched it in the right frame of mind, the true message should stay with you for the rest of your life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
